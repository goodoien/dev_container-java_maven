They will go \"underground\" before they will do that! Our situation is not an isolated case. There are millions of men and women with an understanding of the revelation of God in Jesus Christ, who are still not willing to receive and commit themselves to Him whom the very angels and stars and rivers receive. They hesitate and they delay because they know God is asking the abdication of their own selfish little kingdom and interests. This is the tragedy of mankind, my brethren! We have rejected Him from our lives, because we must have our own way. But until Jesus Christ is sincerely received, there can be no knowledge of salvation nor any understanding of the things of God. The little, selfish, sinful man rejects the Son of God. While he is still enumerating the things he deserves, the Son of God stands outside. My brethren, I repeat: this is the great tragedy of mankind!','Romans 6:13','Yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead.','What a tragedy it is to be unyielding to the only one whose will we cannot escape.','Lord, teach me to listen when you speak and do what you say.'),(2,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','A Christian Virtue','I am being very frank about this, and I hope I am being helpful: do not ever say you are not right with God because you like some people better than others! I believe you can be right with God and still not like the way some people behave. It is easy to love those who are the friendly; others rub us the wrong way or perhaps they cut us down. The writer to the Hebrews has appealed to us as Christian believers to \"let brotherly love continue\"&mdash;in other words, \"never stop loving one another in the Lord.\" Here is what I have found: it is possible to love people in the Lord even though you may not like their boorish or distasteful human traits. We still love them for Jesus\' sake! Yes, I believe you can be right with God and still not like the way some people behave. Our admonition is to love them in a larger and more comprehensive way because we are all one in Christ Jesus. This kind of love is indeed a Christian virtue!','Hebrews 13:1','Let brotherly love continue.','Here is what I have found: it is possible to love people in the Lord even though you may not like their boorish or distasteful human traits. We still love them for Jesus\' sake!','Lord, let brotherly love continue from my life.'),(3,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Toward the Mark','It is one of the devil\'s oldest tricks to discourage Christian believers by causing them to look back at what they once were. It is indeed the enemy of our souls who makes us forget that we are never at the end of God\'s love. No one will make progress with God until the eyes are lifted to the faithfulness of God and we stop looking at ourselves! Our instructions in the New Testament all add up to the necessity of looking forward in faith and not spending our time looking back or just looking within. Brethren, our Lord is more than able to take care of our past. He pardons instantly and forgives completely, and his blood makes us worthy! The goodness of God is infinitely more wonderful than we will ever be able to comprehend. If the \"root of the matter\" is in you and you are born again, God is prepared to start with you where you are!','Philippians 3:13&#150;14','Forgetting things which are behind... I press toward the mark.','No one will make progress with God until the eyes are lifted to the faithfulness of God and we stop looking at ourselves!','Lord, keep my eyes on you as I run this race.'),(4,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Winsome Saints','Much of Christianity overlooks the fact that if we are led by the Spirit of God and if we show forth the love of God this world needs, we become the \"winsome saints.\" The strange and wonderful thing about it is that truly winsome and loving saints do not even know about their attractiveness. The great saints of the past did not know they were great saints. If someone had told them, they would not have believed it; but those around then knew that Jesus was living His life in them. I think we join the winsome saints when God\'s purposes in Christ become clear to us. We join them when we begin to worship God because He is who He is! Brethren, God is not a charity case&mdash;He is not some frustrated foreman who cannot find enough help. Let us remember that God has never actually needed any of us&mdash;not one! But we pretend that He does and we make a big thing of it when someone agrees \"to work for the Lord.\" God is trying to call us back to that for which He created us&mdash;to worship and to enjoy Him forever!','Philippians 1:11','Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Christ Jesus','Let us remember that God has never actually needed any of us&ndash;not one!','Lord, make me mindful of the things you have set out for me to do that will make me a \"winsome saint\" in your eyes.'),(5,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Failure of Religion','Millions of men and women refuse to face up to the fact that religion, in and of itself, is not enough for the sinner\'s need. It is amazing how many things religious people want to do to you. They can start with infant baptism and end up with the last rites when you are 108 years old&mdash;and all of that time they will manipulate you, maul you, and sweet-message your soul. When it is all done, you are, just what you were. You are just a decorated and massaged sinner&mdash;a sinner who did not eat meat, or on the other hand, a sinner who did eat fish! When religion has done all it can, you are still a sinner who either went to church or did not go to church. Religion can put us on the roll and educate us and train us and instruct us. But after all that, there is still something within our beings that cries, \"Eternity is in my heart, and I have not found anything to satisfy it!\" Only our Lord Jesus Christ is enough to satisfy the eternal longing in our souls.','2 Timothy 3:5','Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof...','When religion has done all it can, you are still a sinner who either went to church or did not go to church.','Lord, show me something of what it can mean to be in friendship with You!'),(6,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Striving for Numbers','In Christian circles today, the church that can show an impressive quantitative growth is frankly envied and imitated by other ambitious churches. Numbers, size, and amounts seem to be very nearly all that matter&mdash;with a corresponding lack of emphasis on quality! This is the age of the Laodiceans. The great goddess, Numbers, is worshiped with fervent devotion and all things religious are brought before her for examination. Her Old Testament is the financial report and her New Testament is the membership roll. To these she appeals as the test of spiritual growth and the proof of success or failure in most Christian endeavors. A little acquaintance with the Bible should show this up for the heresy it is. To judge anything spiritual by statistics is to judge by another than scriptural judgment. Yet this is being done every day by ministers, church boards, and denominational leaders. And hardly anyone seems to notice the deep and dangerous error!','Philippians 4:8','Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest... think on these things.','Numbers, size, and amounts seem to be very nearly all that matter&mdash;with a corresponding lack of emphasis on quality!','Lord, as I strive to help build Your Kingdom, let me remember to measure my work by the same standards you do.'),(7,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Someone is There','Wherever faith has proved itself to be real, it has inevitably had upon it a sense of the \"present\" God. The holy Scriptures possess in marked degree this feeling of actual encounter with a real Person. The men and women of the Bible talked with God. They spoke to Him and heard Him speak in words they could understand. With Him they held person-to-person converse, and a sense of shining reality is upon their words and deeds. This sense of \"Someone there\" filled the members of the early Christian church with abiding wonder. The solemn delight which those early disciples knew sprang straight from the conviction that there was One in the midst of them — they were in the very Presence of God! This sense of \"Someone\" there makes religion invulnerable to critical attack. It secures the mind against collapse under the battering of the enemy. Those who worship the God who is present may ignore the objection of unbelieving men!','Psalm 105:4','Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.','The solemn delight which those early disciples knew sprang straight from the conviction that there was One in the midst of them&mdash;they were in the very Presence of God!','May I always remember that you are \"God with us\".'),(8,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Everyday Worship','It is my experience that the totality of our Christian lives — our entire attitude as persons — must be towards the worship of God! If you do not know the presence of God in your office, your factory, your home then God is not in the church you attend, either! I became a Christian when I was a young man working in a tire factory in Akron, Ohio. I remember my work there — but I remember my worship there, too! I had plenty of worshipful tears in my eyes. No one ever asked me about them, but I would not have hesitated to explain them. You can learn to use certain skills until they are automatic. I became so skillful that I could do my work and then I could worship God even while my hands were busy. If the love of God is in us and the Spirit of God is breathing praise within us, all the musical instruments in heaven are suddenly playing in full support! Even our thoughts become a sanctuary in which God can dwell.','Matthew 15:8-9','Their heart is far from me... in vain they do worship me.','I became so skillful that I could do my work and then I could worship God even while my hands were busy.','In all that comes today and everyday, let me worship you with my life, my work, and everything that I do.'),(9,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Misusing the Bible','I believe that everything in the Bible is true, but to attempt to make the Bible a textbook for science is to misunderstand it completely and tragically! It has become a fairly popular practice for Bible teachers to claim to find in the Scriptures confirmation of almost every recent discovery made by science. Apparently, no one noticed that the scientist had to find it before the Bible teacher could, and it never seemed to occur to anyone to wonder why, if it was there in the Bible in such plain sight, it took several thousand years and the help of science before anyone saw it. In recent years, the Bible has been \"recommended\" for many other purposes from the one for which it was written. The purpose of the Bible is to bring men to Christ, to make them holy and prepare them for heaven. Any manipulation of the Scriptures to make them speak peace to the natural man is evil and can only lead to ruin!','2 Peter 3:16','Which they... wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.','In recent years, the Bible has been \"recommended\" for many other purposes from the one for which it was written.','Lord, when I read Your Word, let me discover the most important thing of all, Your will.'),(10,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Game of Pious Words','Do you realize that most men play at religion as they play at games? Religion itself being of all games the one most universally played. The Church has its \"fields\" and its \"rules\" and its equipment for playing the game of pious words. It has its devotees, both laymen and professionals, who support the game with their money and encourage it with their presence, but who are no different in life or character from many who take no interest in religion at all. As an athlete uses a ball so do many of us use words: words spoken and words sung, words written and words uttered in prayer. We throw them swiftly across the field; we learn to handle them with dexterity and grace&mdash;and gain as our reward the applause of those who have enjoyed the game. In the games men play, there are no moral roots. It is a pleasant activity which changes nothing and settles nothing, at last. Sadly, in the religious game of pious words, after the pleasant meeting, no one is basically any different from what he had been before!','James 3:2','If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.','In the games men play there are no moral roots. It is a pleasant activity which changes nothing and settles nothing, at last.','Lord, as I worship You, may I be reminded that Your holiness demands sincerity.'),(11,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Light-And Shadows','A person once called me to ask this question: \"Mr. Tozer, do you think a person who is really a Christian can hurt another Christian?\" There is no easy answer, but I had to reply, \"Yes, I think so.\" Why is it that a man can be on his knees one day, praying earnestly, and the next day be guilty of offending or injuring another Christian? I think it is because we are halfway between heaven and hell. It is because the light&mdash;and the shadow&mdash;fall upon us. The best answer is that we are being saved out of all these contradictions we find in our lifetime. Perhaps on this earth, we will never be able to comprehend fully the awful, terrible price the Lord of all beauty paid to gain our redemption; to save His people from the ugliness of sin. If you do not know Him and worship Him, if you do not long to reside where He is, if you have never known wonder and ecstasy in your soul because of His crucifixion and resurrection, your claim of Christianity has little foundation!','1 Corinthians 13:4','Charity suffereth long, and is kind.','Why is it that a man can be on his knees one day, praying earnestly, and the next day be guilty of offending or injuring another Christian?',' I recognize responsibility for what I think, Father. Help to develop new habit tracks and thought patterns focusing on spiritual reality.'),(12,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Realities of Heaven','Much of the secularism and rationalism of our times dismisses the Christian view and teaching about heaven as \"nothing more than hopeful thinking.\" But the Christian\'s promised hope of future blessedness is founded upon the fullest and plainest revelations of the Old and New Testaments. That it accords with the most sacred yearnings of the human breast does not weaken it, but serves rather to confirm the truth of it, since the One who made the heart might be expected also to make provision for the fulfillment of its deepest longings. God\'s promises are made to the Christian believer, who generally has difficulty picturing himself as inheriting such bliss as the Scriptures describe. The reason is not hard to discover, for the most godly Christian is the one who knows himself best, and no one who knows himself will believe that he deserves anything better than hell. But even justice is on his side, for it is written, \"If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9).','John 14:1-2','Let not your heart be troubled... I go to prepare a place for you.','God\'s promises are made to the Christian believer, who generally has difficulty picturing himself as inheriting such bliss as the Scriptures describe.','Lord, thanks You that my hope is based on truth and that You have given me a saving faith.'),(13,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','God at the Center','After Jacob\'s first memorable encounter with God in the wilderness, he called the place Bethel, which means \"the house of God.\" Many years later, after he had suffered and sinned and repented, and discovered the worthlessness of all earthly things, he renamed the place, Elbethel; literally \"the God of the house of God.\" Thus Jacob had shifted his emphasis from the sacred place to the God he had met there. God Himself now took the center of his interest. We need to consider that many Christians never get beyond Beth-el. God is in their thoughts but He has not been given first place. Faithfulness to the local church is a good thing; but when the church becomes so large and important that it hides God from our eyes, it may become a good thing wrongly used. Always God must be first&mdash;and we ought never forget that the church was never intended to substitute for God! What is our primary interest? Is it Bethel or Elbethel? Is it my church or my Lord? Is it my creed or my Christ?','Genesis 35:7','He built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him.','Faithfulness to the local church is a good thing; but when the church becomes so large and important that it hides God from our eyes, it may become a good thing wrongly used.','Lord, keep Your church always, the house of God.'),(14,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Resources that Endure','The people of this world have always fussed and argued over this world\'s resource&mdash;hope for life, health, financial prosperity, international peace, and a set of favorable circumstances. These resources are good in their own way, but they have a fatal defect&mdash;they are uncertain and transitory! Today, we have them; tomorrow they are gone. It is this way with all earthly things since sin came to upset the beautiful order of nature and made the human race victims of chance and change. We desire for all of God\'s children a full measure of every safe and pure blessing that the earth and sky might unite to bring them. But if in the sovereign will of God things go against us, what do we have left? If life and health are placed in jeopardy, what about our everlasting resources? If the world\'s foundations crumble, we still have God and in Him we have everything essential to our ransomed beings forever! We have Christ, who died for us; we have the Scriptures, which can never fail; we have the faithful Holy Spirit. If worst comes to worst here below, we have our Father\'s house and our Father\'s welcome!','3 John 1:2','I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.','If the world\'s foundations crumble, we still have God and in Him we have everything essential to our ransomed beings forever!','Lord, let me remember that You are the soul provider for everything that I need.'),(15,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Child of Two Worlds','In the kingdom of God, the surest way to lose something is to try to protect it, and the best way to keep it is to let it go. This was the word of our Lord Jesus Christ: \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross!\" Christ turned from the fallen world of Adam and spoke about another world altogether, a world where Adam\'s philosophy is invalid and his technique inoperative. He spoke of the kingdom of God whose laws are exactly opposite to those of the kingdom of men. So, the true Christian is a child of two worlds. He lives among fallen men, but when he is regenerated, he is called to live according to the laws and principles that underlie the new kingdom. He may, then, find himself trying to live a heavenly life after an earthly pattern&mdash;and this is what Paul called \"carnal\" living. That is why it is vitally important to move up into the life of the Spirit of God. Give up your earthly \"treasures,\" and the Lord will keep them for you unto life eternal!','John 18:36','Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world.','Christ turned from the fallen world of Adam and spoke about another world altogether, a world where Adam\'s philosophy is invalid and his technique inoperative.','Lord, make the lure of that which I cannot keep pale in the light of that which I will never lose.'),(16,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','A Sacred Gift of Seeing','As God created us, we all have to some degree the power to imagine. That imagination is of great value in the service of God may be denied by some persons who have erroneously confused the word \"imagination\" with the word \"imaginary.\" The gospel of Jesus Christ has no truck with things imaginary. The most realistic book in the world is the Bible. God is real. Men are real and so is sin and so are death and hell! The presence of God is not imaginary; neither is prayer the indulgence of a delightful fancy. The value of the cleansed imagination in the sphere of religion lies in its power to perceive in natural things shadows of things spiritual. A purified and Spirit-controlled imagination is the sacred gift of seeing; the ability to peer beyond the veil and gaze with astonished wonder upon the beauties and mysteries of things holy and eternal. The stodgy pedestrian mind does no credit to Christianity!','Acts 2:17','Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.','A purified and Spirit-controlled imagination is the sacred gift of seeing; the ability to peer beyond the veil and gaze with astonished wonder upon the beauties and mysteries of things holy and eternal.','Lord, thank you for the many gifts You richly give — most of all for a mind freed by your Holy Spirit to imagine truly beautiful things.'),(17,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Man\'s Empty Promises','We have listened throughout our lifetime to the continuing promises of peace and progress made by the educators and the legislators and the scientists, but so far they have failed to make good on any of them. Perhaps it is an ironic thought that fallen men, though they cannot fulfill their promises, are always able to make good on their threats! Well, true peace is a gift of God, and today it is found only in the minds of innocent children and in the hearts of trustful Christian believers. Only Jesus could say: \"My peace I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled; neither let it be afraid!\" Surely the \"great\" of this world have underestimated the wisdom of the Christian, after all. When the Day of the Lord comes, he may stand like Abraham above the burning plain and watch the smoke rising from the cities that forgot God. The Christian will steal a quick look at Calvary and know that this judgment is past!','1 Thessalonians 5:3','For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them.','We have listened throughout our lifetime to the continuing promises of peace and progress made by the educators and the legislators and the scientists, but so far they have failed to make good on any of them.','Lord, thank You for being at least one friend in life that I can count on to come through in the end.'),(18,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','A Libel Against God','Human sin began with loss of faith in God! When our mother Eve listened to Satan\'s&mdash;sly innuendoes against the character of God, she began to entertain a doubt of His integrity-and right there the doors were opened to the incoming of every possible evil and darkness settled upon the world. Relationship between moral beings is by confidence, and confidence rests upon character, which is a guarantee of conduct. God is a being of supreme moral excellence, possessing in infinite perfection all the qualities that constitute holy character. He deserves and invites the unreserved confidence of every moral creature, including man. Any proper relation to Him must be by confidence, that is, faith. Idolatry is the supreme sin and unbelief is the child of idolatry. Both are libels on the Most High and Most Holy. John wrote: \"He that believeth not God hath made Him a liar.\" A God who would lie is a God without character. Repentance is a man\'s sincere apology for distrusting God for so long, and faith is throwing oneself upon Christ in complete confidence. Thus by faith reconciliation is achieved between God and man!','1 John 5:10','He that believeth not God hath made him a liar.','John wrote: \"He that believeth not God hath made Him a liar.\" A God who would lie is a God without character.','Lord, thank You for being the One in whom my faith will never go unrewarded.'),(19,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Doting On the Past','I always get an uneasy feeling when I find myself with people who have nothing to discuss but the glories of the days that are past! Why are we not willing to believe what the Bible tells us? The Christian\'s great future is before him. Therefore, the whole direction of the Christian\'s look should be forward. It is a fact that we should ponder soberly that so many Christians seem to have their future already behind them! Their glory is behind them. The only future they have is their past. They are always bringing around the cold ashes of yesterday\'s burned-out campfire! Even their testimony, if they give it, reveals their backward look. Their downcast look betrays that they are facing in the wrong direction. We should take Paul for an example here. I think he occasionally took a quick, happy backward look just to remind himself of the grace and goodness of God enjoyed by the maturing believers in their Savior, Jesus Christ!','Isaiah 49:8','In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee.','The Christian\'s great future is before him.','Lord, may I not demand of other believers a level of spiritual maturity that I myself have not attained.'),(20,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Faith and Prayer','In Hebrews, we find a long list of benefits which faith brings to its possessor: justification, deliverance, fruitfulness, endurance, victory over enemies, courage, strength and even resurrection from the dead. Then, everything that is attributed thus to faith might with equal truth be attributed to prayer; for faith and true prayer are like two sides of the same coin&mdash;they are inseparable! Men may, and often do, pray without faith though this is not true prayer, but it is not thinkable that men should have faith and not pray. Whatever God can do, faith can do; and whatever faith can do, prayer can do when it is offered in faith. It should not be considered strange, then, that an invitation to prayer is an invitation to omnipotence, for prayer engages the Omnipresent God and brings Him into our human affairs. According to the Bible, we have because we ask or we have not because we ask not. It does not take much wisdom to discover our next move. Is it not to pray and pray again and again until the answer comes? Let us not fail the world and disappoint God by failing to pray!','James 5:16','The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.','Men may, and often do, pray without, faith though this is not true prayer. But it is not thinkable that men should have faith and not pray.','Lord, as I pray now, let me remember what a privilage I have, and may I be infused with the desire to come to You constantly.'),(21,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Problems and Pressures','Jesus did not promise any of us that consistent Christian living would be easy! He did not promise a release from daily problems and pressures. He did not promise to take us to our heavenly home on a fluffy pink cloud! We live our lives in the knowledge of the grace of God, but we dare not forget that our Lord came to die for us and to express the never-changing moral and redemptive will of God for His people. Before we condemn the Jews of Bible history for their failures, we must be sure that we are not overlooking spiritual and moral shortcomings of our own! As Christian believers, you and I must be careful about the reasons we give for not heeding God&rsquo;s Word and God&rsquo;s warning from heaven. Have we taken His grace seriously enough that we have sought forgiveness for spiritual carelessness, indifference, and apathy?','Romans 8:35','Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?','As Christian believers, you and I must be careful about the reasons we give for not heeding God&rsquo;s Word and God&rsquo;s warning from heaven.','Lord, let me be reminded of the high standard You have set for us. And give me the grace to live up to my potential.'),(22,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Lonely Human','There is a strange contradiction in human nature all around us: the fact that a person can reek with pride, display a swollen ego, and strut like a peacock&mdash;and yet be the loneliest and most miserable person in the world! We find these people everywhere&mdash;pretending and playing a game. Deep within their beings, they are almost overwhelmed by their great loneliness, by their sense of being orphans in the final scheme of things. The result of this strange, aching human sense of loneliness and cosmic orphanage is the inward, groping question: &ldquo;What good is it to be a human being? No one cares about me!&rdquo; In the garden, Eve believed Satan&rsquo;s lie&mdash;the lie that God was not concerned about her and that God had no emotional connection with her life and being. This is where the unregenerate person is in today\'s world. It is only sin and defeat that can bring this sense of orphanage, this sense of having been put out of the father&rsquo;s house, and the feeling that follows when the house is burned down and the father is dead.','Lamentations 5:15-16','The joy of our heart is ceased; woe unto us that we have sinned!','A person can reek with pride, display a swollen ego, and strut like a peacock&mdash;and yet be the loneliest and most miserable person in the world!','Lord, thank You for the reminder that selfish pride leaves only an empty life.'),(23,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Postponing Obedience','A notable heresy has come into being throughout our evangelical Christian circle — the widely accepted concept that we humans can choose to accept Christ only because we need Him as Savior and that we have the right to postpone our obedience to Him as long as we want to! The truth is that salvation apart from obedience is unknown in the sacred Scriptures. Peter makes it plain that we are \"elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience.\" It seems most important to me that Peter speaks of his fellow Christians as \"obedient children.\" He knew their spirituality — he was not just giving them an exhortation to be obedient. The entire Bible teaches that true obedience to God and His Christ is one of the toughest requirements in the Christian life. Actually, salvation without obedience is a self-contradicting impossibility! Humans do not want to admit it, but the Apostle Paul wrote to the Romans long ago that \"by one man\'s disobedience\" came the downfall of the human race!','Acts 16:31','Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.','The entire Bible teaches that true obedience to God and His Christ is one of the toughest requirements in the Christian life.','Lord, let me always remember that odedience to Your will is not just sanctioned but manditory.'),(24,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Humans Judge the Lord?','It is a fact that God made us to worship Him, and if we had not fallen with Adam and Eve, worship would have been the most natural thing for us. Sinning was not the natural thing for Adam and Eve, but they disobeyed and fell, losing their privilege of perfect fellowship with God, the Creator. Sin is the unnatural thing; it was never intended by God to be our nature. Men and women who are out of fellowship with God, the Creator, still have an instinct towards some practice of worship. In most of our \"civilized\" circles, the practice of picking out what we like to worship and rejecting what we do not like is widespread. This has opened up an entire new field for applied psychology and humanism under a variety of religious disguises. Thus men and women set themselves as judges of what the Lord has said&mdash;and so they stand with pride and judge the Lord. In the Bible, God takes the matter of worship out of the hands of men and puts it in the hands of the Holy Spirit. It is impossible to worship God without the impartation of the Holy Spirit!','Matthew 15:9','But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.','In the Bible, God takes the matter of worship out of the hands of men and puts it in the hands of the Holy Spirit.','Lord, thank You for the fact that You have given me the Holy Spirit so that I can worship You in spirit and in truth.'),(25,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Cheap Religion','What passes for Christianity in our day is cheap religion! To listen to the current concepts of Christianity, we would conclude it is little more than bits of beautiful poetry, a man-made bouquet of fragrant flowers, a kindly smile for our neighbor and a couple of good deeds on behalf of a brother or sister. When I consider some of the elements now offered in Christianity as acceptable religion, I have to restrain myself lest I speak too disapprovingly. I fear my words would be so strong that I would have to repent of them! And I read in the Scriptures that there are some things God does not want us to say even about the devil. What do we find surfacing in much of our Christian fellowship? The complaint that God takes a long time to work out His will. We do not want to take the time to plow and cultivate. We want the fruit and the harvest right away. We do not want to be engaged in any spiritual battle that takes us into the long night. We want the morning light right now! We do not want the cross&mdash;we are more interested in the crown!','2 Samuel 24:24','Neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing.','We want the fruit and the harvest right away.

We believe that eternity dwells in the Person of God and that the material universe came into being through God\'s creation. The first man and woman in the human race were created. They failed in their initial encounter with Satan, our archenemy. Following that, the Genesis record becomes a narrative of human failure against the abiding backdrop of God\'s faithfulness. God Himself, through the Holy Spirit, points out a universal problem: the natural brotherhood of human beings is a sinful brotherhood. It is the brotherhood of all who are spiritually lost. But the Bible has good news. It is the revelation of a new brotherhood, the brotherhood of the redeemed! We know it in our time as the believing Church of our Lord Jesus Christ in all nations. It is a new brotherhood among men based on regeneration&mdash;and restoration!','John 1:12','To them gave he power to become the sons of God.','We believe that eternity dwells in the Person of God and that the material universe came into being through God\'s creation.','Lord, thank You for taking me from the brotherhood of the lost to the brotherhood of the redeemed.'),(27,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','God is On Our Side','It was a gracious revelation to my human spirit when I discovered that the Word of God was actually on my side, operating in my behalf! I was reading Psalm 71 and I came to this amazing statement: \"Thou hast given commandment to save me!\" My heart has been warmed with that realization ever since. I believe that the Word of the living God has gone throughout all the earth to save me and keep me! Let the theological experts raise their eyebrow&mdash;I do not care! The living Word has charged Himself with responsibility to forgive, to cleanse, and to keep me! Let us not be guilty of under rating the Word of God operating on our behalf I dare to say that there is not an uncontrolled stroke or force anywhere in all of God\'s mighty universe that can take eternal life away from a trusting, believing, obedient child of God. Let us thank God for the Word! It is living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword!','Psalm 71:13','Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul.','I dare to say that there is not an uncontrolled stroke or force anywhere in all of God\'s mighty universe that can take eternal life away from a trusting, believing, obedient child of God.','Lord, thank You for being infinitely more constant than any foe I could ever face.'),(28,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Top Side of the Soul','It is certainly a reality in our day that too few men and women are willing to keep the \"top side\" of their souls open to God and to His light from heaven. You may wonder about such expression as the \"top side\" of the soul, but I do think it is in line with Bible teaching, and certainly in line with all Christian experience. The heart and soul are open to God in some people\'s lives, but certainly not in others. We should be aware that man\'s forgiveness is not always like God\'s. When a man makes a mistake and has to be forgiven, the shadow may still hang over him among his fellows. But when God forgives, He begins the new page right away. Then when the devil runs up and says, \"What about his past?\" God replies, \"What past? He has been forgiven!\" Now, I think that kind of forgiveness and justification and acceptance with God depends upon a person\'s willingness to keep the \"top side\" of the soul open to God and His saving grace!','Acts 26:18','To open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God.','The heart and soul are open to God in some people\'s lives but certainly not in others.','Lord, thank You for starting fresh with me, and clothing me with a new robe.

But in the end of the age, when the final judgments of God begin to fall, how long will it be until people confess that there is another real, though invisible, force in operation? Truly the wrath of God will leave no hiding place for sinning, alienated men and women! John, in the Revelation, speaks of the mighty trumpets that will sound and the woes that will descend upon the earth. In my own view, I link these events to the dramatic period throughout the earth when the antichrist has prevailed by deception and force. When God is finally ready to refine and restore the earth, everyone in heaven and on earth and in hell will know that no human laboratory could compound the fire that will be poured out on the earth. God has promised that He will not hide His wrath forever. He is prepared to speak in supernatural manifestations in that coming Day of The Lord!','Revelation 17:14','These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them.','God has promised that He will not hide His wrath forever.','Lord, sometimes it seems like things will never be set right because our sight is so short.

Bless the strangers and the friends who happen to be within our gates today. Dear Lord, make them sense that they have found a home among us as we worship, and to realize that they are just as much \"owners\" here as we are; for it is the Lord\'s house and the Lord\'s table — it is not ours. We are all guests and children in the household — all of us! And we pray that we may love Thee acceptably, for we would not wound Thee again! Thou didst love us with such poured-out love that not even the blood in Thy veins was dear enough to Thee — we were dearer than that blood! All of this we ask in Jesus Christ, our Lord.

A seller of purple, Lydia traveled to the market of her day, and undoubtedly she had found freedom and satisfaction in that era when women were not counted at all. But Lydia heard the Apostle Paul tell of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the Lord opened her heart. In Christ she found an eternal answer, which career and position had never been able to give. Now, about conditions today. Our society has set women free to be just as bad as the men-and just as miserable. We have set them free to swear and curse and to set their own morals. Politically, women are now free to vote just as blindly as the men do. But I hope women today will find what Lydia found: that their careers will lack the word \"eternal\" until they find their answer in the eternal Christ, our Lord Jesus!','Acts 16:14','A woman named Lydia, of the city of Thyatira... whose heart the Lord opened.','Our society has set women free to be just as bad as the men&mdash;and just as miserable.','Lord, thank You for the opportunity to have a career that will endure.'),(32,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Rejoice or Grumble','I think all of us meet Christian men and women who always seem to look on the gloomy side and are never able to do anything with life\'s problems but grumble about them!

We do live in a sinful and imperfect world, and as believers in Christ we acknowledge that perfection is a relative thing now&mdash;and God has not really completed a thing with us as yet! Peter testified that the persecuted and suffering Christians of his day were looking, in faith, to a future state of things immeasurably better than that which they knew and that state of things would be perfect and complete!','1 Peter 1:6','Ye greatly rejoice . . . though you are in heaviness through manifold temptations.','We do live in a sinful and imperfect world, and as believers in Christ, we acknowledge that perfection is a relative thing now&mdash;and God has not really completed a thing with us as yet!','Lord, help me to remember that You have not completed Your work with us just yet.'),(33,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Is the Church Weary?','As Christian believers, we stand together in the evangelical faith&mdash;the historical faith of our fathers. Yet, we must confess that many congregations seem bogged down with moral boredom and life-weariness. The Church is tired, discouraged, and unastonished; Christ seems to belong to yesterday. The prophetic teachers have projected everything into the dim future where it is beyond our reach-unavailable! They have dispensationalized us into a state of spiritual poverty&mdash;and they have left us there! But regardless of such teachers, the course of spiritual victory is clear; let us trust what the Word of God continues to say to us! The Scriptures are open and plain. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Lord. He is our great High Priest, alive and ministering for us today. His person, His power and His grace are the same; without change, yesterday, today and forever!','1 John 3:10','In this, the children of God are manifest.','The church is tired, discouraged and unastonished&mdash;Christ seems to belong to yesterday.','Lord, let me not grow weary doing Your work.'),(34,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Claim Your Inheritance','Did you know that it is possible for a Christian believer to live day after day, clutching the book of Ephesians, and still not realize that he is spiritually lean and hungry? If a pastor or evangelist suggests that this person could be in a more prosperous spiritual state, his reaction may be bristling: \"Am I not accepted in the Beloved? Is not God my Father, and am I not an heir with God?\" Holding the text of the will is not enough. It is necessary to come into the possession of the riches. Suppose a rich man dies, leaving a will which passes on all of his millions to his only son. That boy borrows the text of the will from the attorney and carries it around with him. He is satisfied with the text of the will, but it has never been properly executed. Thus the son has never presented his legitimate claims to the inheritance. He may be going around ragged, hungry, and weak. In actual experience, he has received nothing. He simply holds the text of his father\'s will!','3 John 2','That thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.','Is not God my Father, and am I not an heir with God?','Lord, don\'t let me rob myself of my inheritance by forgetting to claim it.'),(35,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Worthy or Unworthy?','The love of Jesus is so inclusive that it knows no boundaries. At the point where we stop loving and caring, Jesus is still there&mdash;loving and caring! The question may be asked: \"How does the living Christ feel today about the sinful men and women who walk our streets?\" There is only one answer: He loves them! We may be righteously indignant about the things they do. We may be disgusted with their actions and their ways. We are often ready to condemn and turn away from them. But Jesus keeps on loving them! It is His unchanging nature to love and seek the lost. He said many times when He was on earth, \"I have come to help the needy. The well do not need a doctor, but the sick need attention and love.\" We are prone to look at the needy and measure them: \"Let us determine if they are worthy of our help.\" During all of His ministry, I do not think Jesus ever helped a \"worthy\" person. He only asked, \"What is your need? Do you need My help?\"','Ephesians 3:19','And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.','I do not think Jesus ever helped a \"worthy\" person.

Do you need My help?\"','Lord, let Your criteria for help be mine, and let me not present a blind eye to those who need me most.'),(36,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','I Choose to Worship','Strange things are happening all around us in Christian circles because we are not truly worshipers. For instance, any untrained, unprepared, unspiritual empty rattletrap of a person can start something \"religious\" and find plenty of followers who will listen and promote it! Beyond that, it may become very evident that he or she had never heard from God in the first place. All of the examples we have in the Bible illustrate that glad and devoted and reverent worship is the normal employment of human beings. Every glimpse that is given us of heaven and of God\'s created beings is always a glimpse of worship and rejoicing and praise-because God is who He is! Because we are not truly worshipers, we spend a lot of time in the churches just spinning our wheels&mdash;making a noise but not getting anywhere. What are we going to do about this awesome, beautiful worship that God calls for? I would rather worship God than do any other thing I know of in all this wide world!','1 Timothy 3:6','Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.','Any untrained, unprepared, unspiritual empty rattletrap of a person can start something \"religious\" and find plenty of followers who will listen and promote it!','Lord, help me to worship You always in spirit and in truth.'),(37,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','A Moral Pronouncement','What is God saying to His human creation in our day and time? In brief, He is saying, \"Jesus Christ is My beloved Son. Hear Him!\" Why is there rejection? Why do men and women fail to listen?Because God\'s message in Jesus is a moral pronouncement. Men and women do not wish to be under the authority of the moral Word of God! For centuries, God spoke in many ways. He inspired holy men to write portions of the message in a book. People do not like it so they try their best to avoid it because God has made it the final test of all morality, the final test of all Christian ethics.God, being one in His nature, is always able to say the same thing to everyone who hears Him. Christian believers must know that any understanding of the Word of God must come from the same Spirit who provided the inspiration!','Psalm 119:105-106','Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path ...

Study the Gospel of John and you will concur with me that John is surely the mystic of the New Testament! Explore the epistles of the Apostle Paul and you will also concur with the assessment that Paul is surely the theologian of the New Testament! John and Paul were completely immersed in love and adoration for Jesus, the Christ, the eternal Son and the Savior of the world. So we may say that Paul is the instrument and John is the music! God Himself was able to pour into the great mind and spirit of Paul the basic doctrines of the New Testament. But in John, God found harp-like qualities to sound forth devotion and praise. Paul, then, is the theologian who lays foundations. John does not really soar any higher than Paul-but he sings just a bit more sweetly! It is not amazing, really, that there is much mysticism in Paul\'s theology, and much theology in John\'s mysticism!','2 Peter 1:21','Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.','God Himself was able to pour into the great mind and spirit of Paul the basic doctrines of the New Testament.

Even the mountains and the islands will be removed from their places. But by then, the prayers and cries of sinful men and women will be too little and too late! All of the great men of the earth, all the important people, all who have mistakenly put their trust and hope in purely human abilities will join those crying out in guilt. They will call on the crumbling rocks and mountains to fall on them to hide them from the wrath of God. I am among those who believe that the judgments of God are certain. We do not know the day nor the hour. But God is indeed going to shake the earth as it has never been shaken before, and He will turn it over to the Worthy One to whom it belongs&mdash;Jesus Christ!','Revelation 6:17','For the great day of his wrath is come; who shall be able to stand?','I am among those who believe that the judgments of God are certain.','Lord, thank You for delivering me from the prospects of Your terrible but just judgemnt.'),(40,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Moral Determination','Though we do not have much of it in this age of spineless religion, there is nevertheless much in the Bible about the place of moral determination in the service of the Lord.

These and many others have left us a record of spiritual greatness born out of a will firmly set to do the will of God! They did not try to float to heaven on a perfumed cloud, but cheerfully accepted the fact that \"with purpose of heart they must cleave to the Lord.\" We must surrender&mdash;and in that terrible, wonderful moment we may feel that our will has been forever broken, but such is not the case. In His conquest of the soul, God purges the will and brings it into union with His own, but He never breaks it!','Acts 11:23','He was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.','Though we do not have much of it in this age of spineless religion, there is nevertheless much in the Bible about the place of moral determination in the service of the Lord.','Lord, thank You for the reminder that my will is no longer mine, but is to be fully surrendered to You for Your glory as is the rest of my life.'),(41,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','God\'s Place as Creator','We make a mistake if we do not learn to admire God in all things, great and small; for a new rich mine would be opened in our consciousness if we could learn to recognize God in nature as well as in grace! We do acknowledge that the God of nature is also the God of grace; and it is true that we glorify God\'s redeeming grace no less when we glorify His creating and sustaining power. When Christ came to redeem us, He stepped into the framework of an afready existent nature. If we will obey and believe, we can go on pushing back the narrow borders of our spiritual world until it takes in the whole creation of God! At one time, the English merchant and renowned poet, William Blake, stood watching the sun come up out of the sea. The bright yellow disk of the sun emerged, gliding the water and painting the sky with a thousand colors. \"Ah! I see gold!\" the merchant said. Blake answered, \"I see the glory of God! And I hear a multitude of the heavenly host crying, \'The whole earth is full of His glory.\'\"','Revelation 4:11','Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things.','We do acknowledge that the God of nature is also the God of grace; and it is true that we glorify God\'s redeeming grace no less when we glorify His creating and sustaining power.','Lord, I do admire You, and I pray that You will remind me that the whole world is full of Your glory.'),(42,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','What Really Matters?','It is all but impossible these days to get people to pay any attention to things that really matter. The broad cynic in our modern civilization is likely to ask: \"What really matters, after all?\" It is our personal relationship to God that really matters! That takes priority over everything else; for no man can afford to live or die under the frowning displeasure of God. Yet, name one modern device that can save him from it. Where can a man find security? Can philosophy help him? Or psychology? Or science? Or atoms, or wonder drugs, or vitamins? Only Christ can help him, and His aid is as old as man\'s sin and man\'s need. A few other things matter to be sure. We must trust Christ completely. We must carry our cross daily. We must love God and our fellow men. We must fulfill our commission as ambassadors of Christ among men. We must grow in grace and in the knowledge of God and come at last to our end like a ripe shock of corn at harvest time. These are the things that really matter!','Ecciesiastes 2:22','For what hath man of all his labour . . . wherein he hath laboured under the sun?','We must trust Christ completely.

I have lost confidence in your character. I am forced to suspect every move you make\"&mdash;such a declaration would instantly alienate friends by destroying the foundation upon which every friendship is built. Until your former friend\'s opinion of you had been reversed, there could be no further communion. People do not go boldly to God and profess that they have no confidence in Him and they usually do not witness publicly to their low view of God. The frightful thing, however, is that people everywhere act out their unbelief with a consistency that is more convincing than words. Christianity provides a way back from this place of unbelief and alienation: \"He that cometh to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.\" God took the wrong upon Himself in order that the one who committed the wrong might be saved!','Hebrews 3:12','Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief.','People do not go boldly to God and profess that they have no confidence in Him, and they usually do not witness publicly to their low view of God.','Lord, purge me from the unbelief that sometimes seperates me from You.

We have been working and earning, getting and spending, and now we are enjoying the creature comforts known to human beings in this land. You may bristle a bit and ask: \"Is there anything wrong with being comfortable?\" Let me answer in this way: if you are a Christian and you are comfortably \"at home\" in Chicago or Toronto, in Iowa or Alberta&mdash;or any other address on planet earth&mdash;the signs are evident that you are in spiritual trouble. The spiritual equation reads like this: the greater your contentment with your daily circumstances in this world, the greater your defection from the ranks of God\'s pilgrims enroute to a city whose architect and builder is God Himself! If we can feel that we have put down our roots in this present world, then our Lord still has much to teach us about faith and attachment to our Savior!','Hebrews 11:13','These all died in faith . . . and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.','If you are a Christian and you are comfortably \"at home\" in Chicago or Toronto, in Iowa or Alberta&mdash;or any other address on planet earth&mdash;the signs are evident that you are in spiritual trouble.','Lord, I pray that You will not let me grow too comfortable here Remind me that this world is not my home, only a temporary residence.

In his faith, Abraham was against idolatry and idol-making, but that was not his crusade. Because of his faith, God led him into a promised land, into possessions and into the lineage that brought forth the Messiah. The call of God is always to something better&mdash;keep that in mind! God calls us into the joys and reality of eternal life. He calls us into purity of life and spirit so that we may acceptably walk with Him. He calls us into a life of service and usefulness that brings glory to Himself as God. He calls us into the sweetest fellowship possible on this earth&mdash;the fellowship of the family of God. If God takes away from us the old, wrinkled, beat-up dollar bill we clutch so desperately, it is only because He wants to exchange it for the whole federal mint, the entire treasury.

A preacher of this gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ should have the authority of God upon him, so that he makes the people responsible to listen to him. When they will not listen to him, they are accountable to God for turning away from the divine Word. A preacher under God\'s unction should reign from his pulpit as a king from his throne. He should not reign by law or by regulation or by man\'s authority. He ought to reign by moral ascendancy. The divine authority is missing from many pulpits. We have \"tabby cats\" with their claws carefully trimmed in the seminary, so they can paw over the congregations and never scratch them at all. The Holy Spirit will sharpen the arrows of the man of God who preaches the whole counsel of God.','2 Timothy 4:2','Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine.','A preacher under God\'s unction should reign from his pulpit as a king from his throne.','Lord, make those who minister to me soothe me when I need to be soothed but scratch me when I need to scratched.'),(47,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Unity of All Things','If we are humble and sincere Christians, this should be one of the most welcome thoughts we have ever considered: the work of Christ in redemption will achieve ultimately the expulsion of sin, the only divisive agent in the universe. When that is accomplished, God\'s creation will once more realize the unification of all things. We who are men and women, though redeemed and regenerated, are submerged in time; therefore we properly say that prophecy is history foretold and history is prophecy fulfilled. But in God there is no \"was\" or \"will be\" but a continuous and unbroken \"is.\" In Him, history and prophecy are one and the same. God contains past and future in His own Being. It is sin that has brought diversity, separation, dissimilarity. Sin has introduced divisions into a universe essentially one. We do not understand this, but we must let our faith rest on the character of God. The concept of the unity of all things is seen in the Scriptures. Paul said that God will reconcile all things unto Himself, whether they be things in earth or in heaven.','Colossians 2:19-20','For it pleased the Father . . . by him to reconcile all things unto himself . . . whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.','The work of Christ in redemption will achieve ultimately the expulsion of sin, the only divisive agent in the universe.','Lord, thank You for being the constant I AM who works in me always.'),(48,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Crossing Over Jordan','The prophets and the psalmists of the Old Testament wrestled as we do with the problem of evil in a divine universe but their approach to God and nature was much more direct than ours. They did not interpose between God and His world that opaque web we moderns call the laws of nature. They could see God in a whirlwind and hear Him in a storm, and they did not hesitate to say so. There was about their lives an immediate apprehension of the divine. Everything in heaven and on earth assured them that this is God&rsquo;s world and that He rules over all. I heard a Methodist bishop tell of being called to the bedside of an elderly dying woman in his early ministry. He said he was frightened; but the old saint was radiantly happy. When he tried to express the sorrow he felt about her illness, she would not hear it. &ldquo;Why, God bless you young man,&rdquo; she said cheerfully. &ldquo;There is nothing to be scared about.

He loves the masses and throngs only because they are made up of individuals. He loves every individual person in the world.&rdquo; In the great humanistic tide of our day, the individual is no longer the concern. We are pressed to think of the human race in a lump. We are schooled to think of the human race in terms of statistics. In many nations, the state is made to be everything and the individual means nothing at all. Into the very face and strength of this kind of humanism comes the Christian evangel, the good news of salvation, wondrously alight with the assurance for all who will listen: &ldquo;You are an individual and you matter to God. His concern is not for genes and species but for the individuals He has created!&rdquo;','Romans 4:8','Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.','Jesus did not come into the world to deal with statistics!','Lord, thank You for dealing with me one on one, and continue to challenge me to seek Your face one on one.'),(50,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Saved From Idolatry','It has been proven often in history that whoever entertains an unworthy conception of God is throwing his or her being wide open to the sin of idolatry, which is in essence, a defamation of the divine character. It is vitally important that we think soundly about God. Since He is the foundation of all our religious belief, it follows that if we err in our ideas of God, we will go astray in everything else. We would like to believe that there are no longer false gods in the world, but actually we recognize some of them in our own society. What about the glorified &ldquo;Chairman of the Board&rdquo; of the modern businessman? Or the story-telling, back-slapping god of some of the service clubs? Think of the dreamy-eyed god of the unregenerate poet cozy, aesthetic, and willing to fellowship with anybody who thinks high thoughts and believes in moral equality. We often encounter the tricky, unscrupulous god of the superstitious; and the list goes on. Thankfully, we have found that to know and follow Christ is to be saved from all forms of idolatry.','Exodus 20:5','Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.','If we err in our ideas of God, we will go astray in everything else.','Lord, help me to remember that there is no replacement for You, and that You are who You are no matter what anyone believes of You.'),(51,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Glamor Instead of Glory','One ominous sign in the social structure that surrounds us is the false attitude toward anything that can be called &ldquo;ordinary.&rdquo; There has grown up all around us an idea that the &ldquo;commonplace&rdquo; is old-fashioned and strictly for the birds. This existing mania for glamor and contempt for the ordinary are signs and portents in American society. Even religion has gone glamorous. In case you do not know what glamor is, I might explain that it is a compound of sex, paint, padding, and artificial lights. It came to America by way of the honky-tonk and the movie lot; got accepted by the world first, then strutted into the Church&mdash;vain, self-admiring, and contemptuous. Instead of the Spirit of God in our midst, we now have the spirit of glamor, as artificial as painted death. Say what you will, it is a new kind of Christianity, with new concepts that face us brazenly wherever we turn within the confines of evangelical Christianity. The new Christian no longer wants to be good or saintly or virtuous.','2 Thessalonians 2:15','Therefore, brethren, standfast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.','Instead of the Spirit of God in our midst, we now have the spirit of glamor, as artificial as painted death.','Lord, do not let our churches be sucked into the whirlpool of glamour. Help us to grow our churches based on the authority of Scripture and not the vanity of men.'),(52,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Getting God in Focus','While many are busy trying to set forth satisfactory definitions of the word &ldquo;faith,&rdquo; we do well to simply consider that believing is directing the heart&rsquo;s attention to Jesus. It is lifting the mind to &ldquo;behold the Lamb of God,&rdquo; and never ceasing that beholding for the rest of our lives. At first this may be difficult, but it becomes easier as we look steadily at His wondrous Person, quietly and without strain. Distractions may hinder, but once the heart is committed to Him, the attention will return again and rest upon Him like a wandering bird coming back to its window. I would emphasize this one great volitional act, which establishes the heart intention to gaze forever upon Jesus. God takes this intention for our choice and makes what allowances He must for the thousand distractions that beset us in this evil world. So, faith is a redirecting of our sight, getting God in our focus, and when we lift our inward eyes upon God, we are sure to meet friendly eyes gazing back at us.','Acts 7:55','But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God.','Faith is lifting the mind to &ldquo;behold the Lamb of God,&rdquo; and never ceasing that beholding for the rest of our lives.','Lord, let me look to You always as the author and finisher of my faith.'),(53,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','A Cheerful Heart','The thankful Christian will turn with true delight to the expression of Joseph Addison in his Thanksgiving hymn, &ldquo;When All Thy Mercies, 0 My God,&rdquo; found in many of the better hymnals. Addison gives a mental image that requires music for its expression: Ten thousand thousand precious gifts my daily thanks employ; nor is the least a cheerful heart that tastes these gifts with joy! Here is the spirit of thanksgiving. Here is the understanding of what pleases God in our acceptance and use of His gifts. &ldquo;A cheefful heart that tastes these gifts with joy&rdquo; is the only kind of heart that can taste them safely. While Addison had in mind chiefly the gifts God showers upon us here below, he was too much of a Christian to think that God\'s gifts would cease at death. So he sang: Through every period of my life thy goodness I\'ll pursue; and after death in distant worlds, the glorious theme renew!','Ephesians 5:19-20','Singing and making melody . . . giving thanks always for all things.','&ldquo;A cheerful heart that tastes these gifts with joy&rdquo; is the only kind of heart that can taste them safely.','Lord, You remind me today of so many things You have given me to be cheerful in, both now, and to come. I am truly thankful.'),(54,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Let Us Be Thankful','To be grateful to God&rsquo;s servants is to be grateful to God; and it follows that in a very real sense we thank God when we thank His people. We will always have spiritual leaders, and I think we make two mistakes in our attitudes toward them. One is not being sufficiently grateful to them. The other is in following them too slavishly. The first is a sin of omission, and because it is something that is not there, it is not likely to be noticed as a sin that is plainly present. We do make a serious mistake when we become so attached to the preaching or writing of a great Christian leader that we accept his teaching without daring to examine it. We should follow men only as they follow the Lord. We should keep an open mind lest we become blind followers of a man whose breath is in his nostrils. Learn from every holy man and his ministry. Be grateful to every one of them and thankful for them&mdash;and then follow Christ.','Ephesians 5:20','Giving thanks always . . . in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.','We should follow men only as they follow the Lord.','Lord, thank You for those who minister to me and for this reminder for me to thank them. Help me to regard them rightly as they follow Your will.'),(55,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','God Gives-And Gives','We ought to spend more time remembering the blessings and the benefits God is continually giving us while we are alive&mdash;before we leave this vale of tears! He gives us forgivenes, so we are to live for Him as forgiven sinners. He gives us eternal life. This is not just a future reality&mdash;our life in Him is a present bestowment. He gives us sonship: &ldquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of God!&rdquo; In this relationship there are many other gifts we receive from God, and if we do not possess them, it is because we are not God&rsquo;s children in faith. We ask God to help us, to meet some need, to do something for you, and the Lord mercifully does it. I consider these the little and the trifling things, yet we make a great deal of them. But they are really the passing things compared to the great present benefactions of forgiveness, reinstatement in favor with God, sonship, and eternal life.','1 Timothy 6:12','Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called.','We ought to spend more time remembering the blessings and the benefits God is continually giving us while we are alive&mdash;before we leave this vale of tears!','Lord, so many things come to my mind as I stop to thank You, and all of them are precious. But the greatest of all is that I am redeemed, and I am Your child.'),(56,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Faithful Stewardship','God has been pleased to deal with us in a most remarkable way concerning our Christian stewardship and responsibility of honoring Him with the things He has entrusted to us. The Bible teaching is plain: you have the right to keep what you have all to yourself, but it will then rust and decay and ultimately ruin you. This may hurt some of you, but I am obliged to tell you that God does not need anything you have. He does not need a dime of your money. What you need to understand is that it is your own spiritual welfare at stake in such matters as this. There is a beautiful and enriching principle involved in our offering to God what we are and what we have, but none of us are giving because there is a depression in heaven. A long time ago God said: &ldquo;If I had need of anything, would I tell you?&rdquo; Brethren, if the living God had need of anything, He would no longer be God!','1 Corinthians 16:2','Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him.','God does not need anything you have!','Lord, help me to remember the reasons that I give to Your work and make me a faithul trustee of the blessings You give me.'),(57,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Live for God\'s Glory','It may be difficult for the average Christian to get hold of the idea that his daily labors can be performed as acts of worship acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. We must practice living to the glory of God actually and determinedly. By one act of consecration of our total selves to God we can make every subsequent act express that consecration. By meditation upon this truth, by talking it over with God often in our prayers, by recalling it to our minds frequently as we move about among men, a sense of its wondrous meaning will begin to take hold of us. The New Testament accepts as a matter of course that in His incarnation, our Lord took upon Him a real human body. He lived in that body here among men and never once performed a non-sacred act. Brethren, we must offer all our acts to God and believe that He accepts them. We should then keep reminding God in our times of private prayer that we mean every act for His glory. We thus meet the temptations and trials by the exercise of an aggressive faith in the sufficiency of Christ.','Romans 15:6','That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.','Our Lord took upon Him a real human body. He lived in that body here among men and never once performed a non-sacred act.','Lord, I live every moment of this day to fulfil Your desires in me. Remind me as I do each task that You are my sufficiency.'),(58,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Why am I Here?','Since the first fallen man got still long enough to think, fallen men have been asking these questions: &ldquo;Whence came I? What am I? Why am I here? and Where am I going?&rdquo; The noblest minds of the race have struggled with these questions to no avail. Did the answer lie somewhere hidden like a jewel it would surely have been uncovered, for the most penetrating minds of the race have searched for it everywhere in the region of human experience. Yet the answers remain as securely hidden as if they did not exist. Why is man lost philosophically? Because he is lost morally and spiritually. He cannot answer the questions life presents to his intellect because the light of God has gone out in his soul. The fearful indictment the Holy Ghost brings against mankind is summed up count by count in the openings of Romans and the conduct of every man from earliest recorded history is evidence enough to sustain the indictment. Apart from the Scriptures, we have no sure philosophy, apart from Jesus Christ we have no true knowledge of God; apart from the inliving Spirit, we have no ability to live lives morally pleasing to God.','Romans 1:25, 28','Who worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator . . . God gave them over to a reprobate mind.','Why is man lost philosophically? Because he is lost morally and spiritually.','Lord, You are the foundation of a life with any basis and meaning. Help us to remember that when we strive to reach those who are searching for those very things.'),(59,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Nothing But Sweetness','Let me caution you about the attitudes of some of the bubbly &ldquo;happy, happy&rdquo; people in our congregations who will insist that the Word of God can never be anything but honey sweet. Fellow believers, when we digest, absorb, and soak up the Word of the Lord, it becomes part and parcel of our daily lives. It is our delight. It is indeed honey and sweetness. But as we share that same Word in our witness to lost men and women, we will know something of bitterness and hostility, even enmity. It will follow then in experience, that Christian believers who are intent upon being faithful witnesses for Jesus Christ may not always find sweetness and light in their contacts with evil, rebellious people. We need to pray for men and women in our churches who have determined to set their own agendas&mdash;to live their lives as they please. They have determined to manage the influences of the Word of God in their lives.','Revelation 10:10','It was in my mouth as sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.','Fellow believers, when we digest, absorb, and soak up the Word of the Lord, it becomes part and parcel of our daily lives. It is our delight.','Lord, keep the message of Your Word sweet to me by creating in me a spirit which is in harmony with its teaching, but let me not be afraid to deal with the other emotions it may bring in this world that is defiant of that same Word.'),(60,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Thoughts On Communion','What a sweet comfort to us that our Lord Jesus Christ was once known in the breaking of the bread. In earlier Christian times, believers called the Communion &ldquo;the medicine of immortality,&rdquo; and God gave them the desire to pray: Be known to us in breaking bread, but do not then depart; Savior, abide with us and spread Thy table in our heart. Some churches have a teaching that you will find God only at their table-and that you leave God there when you leave. I am so glad that God has given us light. We may take the Presence of the table with us. We may take the Bread of life with us as we go. Then sup with us in love divine, Thy body and Thy blood; That living bread and heavenly wine Be our immortal food! In approaching the table of our Lord, we dare not forget the cost to our elder Brother, the Man who was from heaven. He is our Savior; He is our Passover!','Luke 24:30-31','He took bread . . . and their eyes were opened, and they knew him.','We may take the Presence of the table with us.

By the Word of God I do not refer only to the book you hold in your hand&mdash;paper and letters, pages and ink&mdash;sewed together with silk thread. By the Word of God I do mean the expression of the mind of God: the mighty, world-filling breath of God. Most of the things men and women talk about cannot be counted among the great realities of life. In October, people talk a great deal about the World Series as a great reality, but by December they have forgotten who pitched and who struck out. People spend their entire lives in the pursuit of those things that can only perish and fade away. But when it is all over, they are still going to be faced with the reality of the eternal Word of God, the revelation of truth which God has given us. Think of the changes that would come if humans would suddenly stop and hear the Word of God.','John 12:2','The word that I have spoken . . . shall judge him in the last day.','By the Word of God I do mean the expression of the mind of God: the mighty, world-filling breath of God.','Lord, there are so many things to take in from moment to moment, but, today, let the things that I learn from be directly inspired from Your Word.'),(62,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Life Flows From God','Without doubt, we have suffered the loss of many spiritual treasures because we have let slip the simple truth that the miracle of the perpetuation of life is in God. Be assured that God did not create life and toss it from Him like some petulant artist disappointed with his work. All life is in Him and out of Him, flowing from Him and returning to Him again, a moving indivisible sea of which He is the fountainhead. That eternal life which was with the Father is now the possession of believing men and women, and that life is not God&rsquo;s gift only&mdash;but His very self! The regeneration of a believing soul is but a recapitulation of all His work done from the moment of creation. So, redemption is not a strange work which God for a moment turned aside to do; rather it is His same work performed in a new field, the field of human catastrophe.','Genesis 1:31','God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.','All life is in Him and out of Him, flowing from Him and returning to Him again, a moving indivisible sea of which He is the fountainhead.','Lord, let me remember that every aspect of my life is in Your hands, and let me take comfort in that fact.'),(63,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Let Us Take it Personally','What a difference it makes when we humans cease being general and become pointed and personal in our approach to God. We then come to see that all that God did was for each of us. It was for me that holy men spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. For me Christ died, and when He arose on the third day it was for me. When the promised Holy Spirit came it was to continue in me the work He had been doing for me, since the morning of the Creation. So, I have every right to claim all of the riches of the Godhead in mercy given. What a blessed thought&mdash;that an infinite God can give all of Himself to each of His children. He does not distribute Himself that each may have a part, but to each one He gives all of Himself as fully as if there were no others. All that He is and all that He has done is for us and for all who share the common salvation.','Isaiah 26:12','Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.','I have every right to claim all of the riches of the Godhead in mercy given.','Lord, thank You for the rich inheritance that is mine since You made me your son.

As God&rsquo;s people, we are so often confused that we could be known as God&rsquo;s poor, stumbling, bumbling people, for we are most prone to think of worship as something we do when we go to church on Sunday. We call it God&rsquo;s house. We have dedicated it to Him. So, we continue with the confused idea that it must be the only place where we can worship Him. We come to the Lord&rsquo;s house, made of brick and stone and wood. We are used to hearing the call to worship: &ldquo;The Lord is in His holy temple&mdash;let us kneel before Him!&rdquo; This is on Sunday and in church&mdash;very nice! But on Monday, as we go about our different duties, are we aware of the continuing presence of God? The Lord desires still to be in His holy temple, wherever we are; for each of us is a temple in whom dwells the Holy Spirit of God.','2 Corinthians 6:16','For ye are the temple of the living God.','The Lord desires still to be in His holy temple, wherever we are.','Lord, let me remember today, and always, that You live in this temple that is me. May I recognize the significance of that and live like I know it.'),(65,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Let the Day Dawn','The Bible tells us that when a person becomes a Christian, it is as though the sun has come up and the day has dawned. Then his experience along the path should be like the glowing light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day. This brings us to a question: if all Christians are alike in standing and state, why did Jesus point out three distinctions in the Christian life&mdash;&ldquo;some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred fold&rdquo;? If we are all alike and have all &ldquo;arrived&rdquo; at the same place and state, why did the Apostle Paul tell the Philippian Christians &ldquo;I have suffered the loss of all things, that I may know Him and if by any means, I might attain unto that superior resurrection&rdquo;? I am of the opinion that we cannot experience that which we have not believed. I still think we must instruct and urge men and women, toiling along in average and common Christian ways to move forward and claim spiritual victory they have not yet known.','Proverbs 4:18','The path of the just . . . shineth more and more unto the perfect day.','I am of the opinion that we cannot experience that which we have not believed.','Lord, give the spriritual victory today in every new challenge, and teach me the things You have specifically for me to learn.'),(66,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Everyone May Come','There is a strange beauty in the ways of God with men. He sends salvation to the world in the person of a Man and sends that Man to walk the byways, saying, &ldquo;If any man will come after Me . . . &rdquo; No fanfare, no tramp of marching feet. A kindly Stranger walks through the earth, and so quiet is His voice that it is sometimes lost in the hurly-burly; but it is the last voice of God, and until we become quiet to hear it, we have no authentic message. &ldquo;If any man,&rdquo; He says, and teaches at once the universal inclusiveness of His invitation and the freedom of the human will. Everyone may come; no one need come, and whoever does come, comes because he chooses to. Every man thus holds his future in his hand. Not the dominant world leader only but the inarticulate man lost in anonymity is &ldquo;a man of destiny.&rdquo; He decides which way his soul shall go. He chooses, and destiny waits on the nod of his head. He decides, and hell enlarges itself, or heaven prepares another mansion. So much of Himself has God given to man!','Revelation 22:17','Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.','It is the last voice of God, and until we become quiet to hear it, we have no authentic message.','Lord, thank You that even when I was not capable of discerning any truly spiritual thing, You planted in me the seed of thought that turned my will to You so that when it came to my choice, it was a choice based on knowlege before unseen.'),(67,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Where is the Radiance?','I keep looking, but with little success, for a distinguishing radiance in life and testimony among our evangelical Christians. Instead of an inner witness, too many professing Christians are depending upon logical conclusions drawn from Bible texts. They have no witness of an encounter with God, no awareness of inner change. I believe that where there is a divine act within the soul, there will be a corresponding awareness. This act of God is its own evidence: it addresses itself directly to the spiritual consciousness. Thankfully, there are elements that are always the same among men and women who have had a personal meeting with God. There is the compelling sense of God Himself&mdash;of His Person and of His Presence. From there on, the permanent results will be evident in the life and walk of the person touched as long as he or she lives!','1 John 5:10','He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself.','Instead of an inner witness, too many professing Christians are depending upon logical conclusions drawn from Bible texts.','Lord, let the witness of Your Spirit in my life be the most compelling motivation for my convictions.

Surely it is a message of pardon&mdash;and for that may God be praised&mdash;but it is also a message of repentance! It is a message of atonement&mdash;but it is also a message of temperance and righteousness and godliness in this present world. It tells us that we must accept a Savior, but it tells us also that we must deny ungodliness and worldly lusts. The gospel message includes the idea of amendment, of separation from the world, of cross-carrying and loyalty to the Kingdom of God even unto death. These are all corollaries of the gospel and not the gospel itself; but they are part and parcel of the total message which we are commissioned to declare. No man has authority to divide the truth and preach only a part of it. To do so is to weaken it and render it without effect.','2 Corinthians 7:10','For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of.','No man has authority to divide the truth and preach only a part of it.','Lord, thank You for the reminder that I undertook much more than a spiritual bath when I accepted Your saving grace.

Abraham sent his trusted servant to his former homeland to select a bride for Isaac. The adornment of Rebekah&rsquo;s beauty consisted of jewels and the raiment that came as gifts of love from the bridegroom whom she had not yet seen. It is a reminder of what God is doing in our midst right now. Abraham typifies God the Father; Isaac, our Lord Jesus Christ, the heavenly Bridegroom. The servant who went with the gifts into the far country to claim a bride for Isaac speaks well of the Holy Spirit, our Teacher and Comforter. He gives us, one by one, the gifts and the graces of the Holy Spirit that will be our real beauty in His sight. Thus we are being prepared, and when we meet our coming Lord and King, our adornment will be our God-given graces!','Hebrews 2:4','. . . gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.','Our adornment will be our God-given graces!','Lord, the gifts You give us sparkle as jewels when we use them for Your glory, let us always remember the promises of those gifts.

The answer to the question, &ldquo;Where did I come from?&rdquo; can never be better answered than by the Christian mother who tells her child, &ldquo;God made you.&rdquo; The great store of knowledge in today&rsquo;s world cannot improve on that simple answer. The scientist can tell us the secrets of how matter operates, but the origin of matter lies in deep silence, refusing to give an answer to man&rsquo;s question. It is important for Christian believers to be able to stand firmly and positively in this declaration: &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord!&rdquo; Our chief business is not to argue or to persuade our generation. With our positive declaration of God&rsquo;s Word and revelation, we make God responsible for the outcome. No one can know enough to go beyond this.','Proverbs 2:6','The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.','The answer to the question, &ldquo;Where did I come from?&rdquo; can never be better answered than by the Christian mother who tells her child, &ldquo;God made you.&rdquo;','Lord, it is sometimes hard to understand how things happen, but thank You just the same, may I continue to learn what an awseome God I serve.'),(71,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Need for Reverence','Many persons who have been raised in our churches no longer think in terms of reverence, which seems to indicate that they doubt God&rsquo;s presence is there. Much of the blame must be placed on the growing acceptance of a worldly secularism that seems much more appealing than any real desire for the spiritual life that is pleasing to God. We secularize God; we secularize the gospel of Christ and we secularize worship. No great and spiritually minded men of God are going to come out of such churches, nor any great spiritual movement of believing prayer and revival. If God is to be honored and revered and truly worshiped, He may have to sweep us away and start somewhere else. Let us confess that there is a necessity for true worship among us. If God is who He says He is and if we are the believing people of God we claim to be, we must worship Him! In my own assessment, for men and women to lose the awareness of God in our midst is a loss too terrible ever to be appraised!','Psalm 89:7','God is greatly to be feared . . . and to be had in reverence.','Let us confess that there is a necessity for true worship among us.','Lord, help me remember that You are present with me, and help me to worship You with the reverence and respect You deserve.'),(72,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','More Than a Name','There have always been professing Christians who argue and insist: &ldquo;I am all right&mdash;I worship in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; They seem to believe that worship of God is based on a formula. They seem to think there is a kind of magic in saying the name of Jesus! Study the Bible carefully with the help of the Holy Spirit and you will find that the name and the nature of Jesus are one. It is not enough to know how to spell Jesus\' name! If we have come to be like Him in nature, if we have come to the place of being able to ask in accordance with His will, He will give us the good things we desire and need. We worship God as the result of a new birth from above in which God has been pleased to give us more than a name. He has given us a nature transformed, and Peter expresses that truth in this way: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust (2 Peter 1:4).','2 Timothy 2:19','Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.','We worship God as the result of a new birth from above in which God has been pleased to give us more than a name.','Lord, thank You for the ability to worship You as You would have me worship You, in Spirit and in Truth.'),(73,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Glory to God','When the Holy Spirit comes among us with His anointing, we become a worshiping people!

When Jesus came into Jerusalem presenting Himself as Messiah, there was a great multitude and there was a great noise. Very often our worship is audible, but I do not believe it is necessarily true that we are worshiping God when we are making a lot of racket. But I think there is a word for those who are cultured, quiet, self-possessed, poised, and sophisticated. If they are embarrassed in church when some happy Christian says &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; they may actually be in need of some spiritual enlightenment. If some believer\'s &ldquo;Glory to God!&rdquo; really bothers you, it may be because you do not know the kind of spiritual blessing and delight the Holy Spirit is waiting to provide among God\'s worshiping saints. I can only speak for myself, but I want to be among those who worship!','1 Peter 4:14','The spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.','Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, believers everywhere are united in their praises to God.','Lord, thank You that through Your Spirit we have a joy in worship that can not be had in any other way.'),(74,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Better Farther On','Truth that is not experienced is no better than error and may be fully as dangerous.

The man who believes that he has &ldquo;arrived&rdquo; will not go any further; and the present neat habit of quoting a text to prove we have arrived may be a dangerous one if, in truth, we have no actual inward experience of the text. The great saints of the past have all had yearning hearts. Their longing after God all but consumed them; it propelled them onward and upward to heights toward which less ardent Christians look with languid eye and entertain no hope of reaching. May we offer this word of exhortation: pray on, fight on, sing on! Press on into the deep things of God. Keep your feet on the ground, but let your heart soar as high as it will!','Luke 24:45','Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.','We should see that one of the greatest foes of the Christian is religious complacency.','Lord, help me to practice what I know.

This is what I mean: if in this life we are not really comfortable talking and singing about heaven and its joy, I doubt that death will transform us into enthusiasts! If the worship and adoration of God are tedious now, they will be tedious also after the hour of death. I do not know that God is going to force any of us into His heaven. I doubt that He will say to any of us, &ldquo;You were never very interested in worshiping Me while you were on earth, but in heaven I am going to make that your greatest interest and your ceaseless occupation.&rdquo; Controversial? Perhaps, but in the heavenly scene John describes, the living creatures crying &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy!&rdquo; rest neither day nor night. My fear is that too many of God\'s professing people down here are resting far too often between their efforts to praise and glorify the living God!','Revelation 4:8','They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty.','If the worship and adoration of God are tedious now, they will be tedious also after the hour of death.','Lord, give me the will to worship You now as I will worship in heaven.'),(76,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Secret Working of God','I do believe in the secret and mysterious working of God in the human breast. I must believe it after finding the forgiving and converting grace of God in the Savior, Jesus Christ. My father and mother held high human standards, but completely without any thought of God. My parents appeared to be without any spark of desire after God; attitudes that were cold, earthy, profane. Can you tell me why, then, at the age of 17, as a boy surrounded by unbelief&mdash;l00 percent&mdash;I could find my way to my mother\'s attic, kneel on my knees, and give my heart and life in committal to Jesus Christ? I cannot tell you why. I can only say that I know there is such a thing as the secret workings of God within the human being who has a sensitivity to hear the call of God. In my own case, I do have the testimony that my conversion to Jesus Christ was as real as any man\'s conversion has ever been! My fellow man, if the Spirit of God is still tugging at your heart, thank God&mdash;and follow the light!','Titus 3:7','That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.','I cannot tell you why.

My father was 60 years old when he bowed before Jesus Christ and was born again. That was a near lifetime in which he had sinned and lied and cursed. But to him, the mercy of God that took him to heaven was no greater than the mercy of God that had endured and kept him for 60 years. I recall the story of an ancient rabbi who consented to take a weary old traveler into his house for a night of rest. In conversation, the rabbi discovered the visitor was almost 100 years old and a confirmed atheist. Infuriated, the rabbi arose, opened the door and ordered the man out into the night. Then, sitting down by his candle and Old Testament, it seemed he heard a voice, God&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;I have endured that sinner for almost a century. Could you not endure him for a night?&rdquo; The rabbi ran out and overtaking the old man, brought him back to the hospitality of his home for the night.','Ephesians 2:4-5','God, who is rich in mercy . . . even when we were dead in sins.','A human being is never really aware of the great boundless sea of the mercy of God until by faith he comes across the threshold of the Kingdom of God and recognizes it and identifies it!','Lord, thank You for Your mercy beyond measure.

The lifetime God has given us down here is a lifetime of decisions. Each person makes his own decisions as to the eternal world he is going to inhabit. We must decide to take Jesus for what He is&mdash;the anointed Savior and Lord who is King of kings and Lord of all lords! He would not be who He is if He saved us and called us without the understanding that He can also guide us and control our lives. The root of sin is rebellion against God, and hell is the Alcatraz for the unconstituted rebels who refuse to surrender to the will of God. There are many arguments about the reality of hell. A man might endure fire and brimstone and worm, but the essence of hell and judgment for a moral creature is to know and be conscious that he is where he is because he is a rebel! Hell will be the eternal domain of all the disobedient rebels who have said, &ldquo;I owe God nothing!&rdquo;','Psalm 119:35','Make me to go in the path of thy commandments, for therein do I delight.','Our Lord will not save those whom He cannot command!','Lord, command me and I will obey.

If we have any spiritual concerns, our most pressing obligation is to do all in our power to obtain a revival that will result in a reformed, revitalized, purified Church. Each generation of Christians is the seed of the next, and degenerate seed is sure to produce a degenerate harvest; not a little better than but worse than the seed from which it sprang. Thus the direction will be down until vigorous, effective means are taken to improve the seed. Why is it easier to talk about revival than to experience it? Because followers of Christ must become personally and vitally involved in the death and resurrection of Christ. And this requires repentance, prayer, watchfulness, self-denial, detachment from the world, humility, obedience and cross-carrying!','2 Corinthians 4:16','Though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day.','Our most pressing obligation is to do all in our power to obtain a revival that will result in a reformed, revitalized, purified Church.','Lord, let me experience the type of Christianity You intended for me to have, and give me the strength to work for it.'),(80,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Do You Love Beauty?','When we look closely at this world system and society, we see the terrible and ugly scars of sin.

If you love beautiful things, you had better stay out of hell, for hell will be the quintessence of all that is morally ugly and obscene. Hell will be the ugliest place in all of creation! It is a fact that earth lies between all that is ugly in hell and all that is beautiful in heaven.

When Jesus came, many realized that it would mean probable financial loss for them to step out and follow Christ. Also, many of those men and women who considered the claims of Christ in His day knew that following Him would call for abrupt and drastic changes in their patterns of living. The proud and selfish aspects of their lives would have been disturbed. Beyond that, there was an almost complete disdain for the inward spiritual life which Jesus taught as a necessity for mankind; that it is the pure in heart who will see God! I am afraid that humanity\'s choice would still be the same today. People are still more in love with money and pride and pleasure than they are with God and His salvation!','Luke 19:14','We will not have this man to reign over us.','People are still more in love with money and pride and pleasure than they are with God and His salvation!','Lord, while I look at the world and know it is still rebellious and self-absorbed, I thank You for coming despite Your reception.'),(82,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Word Made Flesh','I have given much thought and contemplation to the sweetest and tenderest of all of the mysteries in God&rsquo;s revelation to man&mdash;the Incarnation!

I confess that I would have liked to have seen the baby Jesus. But the glorified Jesus yonder at the right hand of the Majesty on high, was the baby Jesus once cradled in the manger straw. Taking a body of humiliation, He was still the Creator who made the wood of that manger, made the straw, and was Creator of all the beasts that were there. In truth, He made the little town of Bethlehem and all that it was. He also made the star that lingered over the scene that night. He had come into His own world, His Father\'s world. Everything we touch and handle belongs to Him. So we have come to love Him and adore Him and honor Him!','Matthew 3:17','And lo, a voice from heaven saying, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.','Taking a body of humiliation, He was still the Creator who made the wood of that manger, made the straw, and was Creator of all the beasts that were there.','Lord, I am so thankful that You the creator came to be among and save the created.'),(83,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Christmas Is Real','The birth of Christ was a divine declaration, an eternal statement to a race of fallen men and women.

With the emergence into human flesh of the Eternal Word of the Father, the fact of man\'s divine origin is confirmed. Third, that God indeed had spoken by the prophets. The coming of the Messiah-Savior into the world confirmed the veracity of the Old Testament Scripture. Fourth, that man is lost but not abandoned. Had men not been lost, no Savior would have been required. Had they been abandoned no Savior would have come. Finally, that this world is not the end. We are made for two worlds and as surely as we now inhabit the one we shall also inhabit the other!','1 Timothy 3:16','Great is the mystery . . .

How much profit will it bring?&rdquo; The believing children of God once upon a time saw God in everything. They were enraptured with everything before them. There was no common hill; they were all the hills of God! There was no common cloud; they were the chariots of God! They saw God in everything: in our day we never look up in happy surprise! But let me tell you that it has been a never-failing delight throughout my years to watch little children on Christmas morning. The gifts may be humble, but the child\'s burst of spontaneous delight and wonder is genuine and rewarding. That incredulous look in the child\'s face&mdash;everything is full of wonder and beauty! Sad, indeed, for adults to lose the wonder in worship&mdash;for worship is wonder and wonder is worship!','Luke 2:10','Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy.','It has been a never-failing delight throughout my years to watch little children on Christmas morning.','Lord, thank You for the deep joy and wonder each Christams brings to my life.'),(85,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Happy Morn','When we sing &ldquo;The Light of the world is Jesus,&rdquo; there should be a glow on our faces that would make the world believe indeed that we really mean it!

That glorious form, that Light insufferable, And that far-beaming blaze of majesty, He laid aside, and here with us to be, Forsook the courts of everlasting Day, And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.

It is my own feeling that when Jesus came, all of nature went out to greet Him. The star led the wise men from the East. The cattle in the stable stall in Bethlehem did not bother Him. His own things in created nature received Him. Dr. G. Campbell Morgan believed that when Jesus went into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, He was there with the wild beasts for 40 days and nights. Dr. Morgan held that there had been a wrong conception, as if Jesus needed angelic protection from the animals. Jesus was perfectly safe there. He was nature\'s Creator and Lord. Jesus was in total harmony with nature, and I am of the opinion that the deeper our Christian commitment becomes, the more likely we will find ourselves in tune and in harmony with the natural world around us!','Matthew 4:11','Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.','It is my own feeling that when Jesus came, all of nature went out to greet Him.','Lord, let me join with those who worship You as creater and Lord of all.'),(87,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Better Than Gold','Every Christian believer should be aware that our God has given us definite promises of an amazing inheritance to be realized in the eternal!

We must remember that an inheritance has not actually been earned. Such bequests come from One who owns everything and gives to another whom He delights to honor and who can establish his rightful claim. Inheritance is a right resulting from a relationship. In this case, the right belongs to the children of God by virtue of the fact that their identification as children of God by faith in the eternal Son of God has been established and is in the heavenly records! The apostle said of us: \"Men and women cannot imagine or even dream of all the things which God has prepared for those who love Him!\"','1 Corinthians 3:12','That ye might know the things that are freely given to us of God.','God has given us definite promises of an amazing inheritance to be realized in the eternal!','Lord, I am so thankful for all of the things You have bestowed upon me as an adopted child.'),(88,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Christ\'s Picture Everywhere','We try to sympathize with the writer John as he attempts to describe heavenly creatures in human terms in the Book of Revelation.

The first was like a lion; the second was like an ox; the third had the face of a man; the fourth was like a soaring eagle. Did you know that for centuries Christians have seen those same \"faces\" in the four gospels of the New Testament? God has put Jesus Christ\'s picture everywhere! Matthew\'s is the gospel of the King. Mark\'s, the gospel of the suffering Servant. Luke\'s, the gospel of the Son of Man. John\'s, the gospel of the Son of God. Four loving, adoring, worshiping beings, faithfully and forever devoted to praising God! Make no mistake about it: the imagery is plainly the gospel of Christ.

Brother, these are only the external counterparts of a deeper and more enduring beauty&mdash;that which we call moral beauty. It has been the uniqueness and the perfection of Christ\'s moral beauty that have charmed even those who claimed to be His enemies throughout the centuries of history. We do not have any record of Hitler saying anything against the moral perfection of Jesus. One of the great philosophers, Nietzsche, objected to Paul\'s theology of justification by faith, but he was strangely moved within himself by the perfection of moral beauty found in the life and character of Jesus, the Christ. We should thank God for the promise of heaven being the place of supreme beauty-and the One who is all&mdash;beautiful is there!','Isaiah 35:2','They shall see the glory of the Lord; and the excellency of our God.','It has been the uniqueness and the perfection of Christ\'s moral beauty that have charmed even those who claimed to be His enemies throughout the centuries of history.','Lord, thank You for showing us true beauty in Your life, and thank You for the opportunity to share eternity with You.'),(90,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','God\'s Sovereign Plan','Many people continue to live in daily fear that the world \"is coming to an end.\" Only in the Scriptures do we have the description and prediction of the age-ending heavenly and earthly events when our Lord and Savior will be universally acknowledged as King of kings and Lord of lords.

But no human being or world government will have any control in that fiery day of judgement yet to come. John\'s vision of things to come tells us clearly and openly that at the appropriate time this world will be taken away from men and placed in the hands of the only Man who has the wisdom and authority to rightly govern.

I would like to see this sense of glory recaptured throughout the church-too many Christians do not expect to experience any of the glory until they see Him face to face! Within our Christian fellowship and worship, we must recapture the Bible concepts of the perfection of our God Most High! We have lost the sense and the wonder of His awe-fullness, His perfection, His beauty. Oh, I feel that we should preach it, sing it, write about it, talk about it and tell it until we have recaptured the concept of the Majesty of God!

But God never meant it to be so. I recall being invited to speak at a summer conference where much of the emphasis is upon fun and amusement and jokes, something like Hollywood, I suppose. After my sessions there, the pastor-director told me frankly of his wife\'s reaction: \"Honey, after listening to Dr. Tozer, can it be true that there isn\'t anything good in this world?\" Well, I know she had a Bible in her house and I consider her query one of the foolish questions of our times. Of course the world makes its own argument that there are things that can be considered good on the human level-but they belong to us only for a brief day. Nothing is divinely good until it bears the imprint of our Lord Jesus Christ! Men and women may argue and make excuses, but it does not change the fact that in our human society we are completely surrounded by three marks of the ancient curse: everything is recent, temporal and transient!

Many others have made a variety of claims but only our Christ is the Christ of God. Certainly it was not Buddha and not Mohammed; not Joseph Smith, not Mrs. Eddy, and not Father Divine!

Moses could not save anyone, but Jesus Christ is both Savior and Lord. Grace came through Jesus Christ before Mary wept in the manger stall in Bethlehem. It was the grace of God in Christ that saved the human race from extinction when our first parents sinned in the Garden. It is plain in history that God forgave Israel time and time again.

So we wonder: How could the Infinite ever become finite? And: How could the Limitless One deliberately impose limitations upon Himself? In the Book of Hebrews, we learn to our amazement that God took not upon Him the nature of angels, but He took upon Him the seed of Abraham. We would suppose that God in stepping down would step down just as little as possible. But instead, He came down to the lowest order and took upon Himself the nature of Abraham&mdash;the seed of Abraham. I like what John Wesley said concerning this mysterious act of God in stooping down to tabernacle with us: we should be sure to distinguish the act from the method by which the act is performed. Do not reject a fact because we do not know how it was done, Wesley advised. With the saints of all ages, we do well just to throw up our hands and confess: \"Oh Lord, Thou knowest!\"','John 1:14','The Word was made flesh . . . and dwelt among us.','God took not upon Him the nature of angels, but He took upon Him the seed of Abraham.','Dearest Lord, I will not know how You could stoop to be with us, until I can look through the eyes of unfailing grace.

Talk to them and they will predictably flare up: \"Isn\'t grace something for nothing?\" That depends upon what kind of grace we are talking about. Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer gave his life as a martyr in Hitler\'s Germany, but he left a book now known around the world: The Cost of Discipleship. He pointed out a sharp distinction between \"cheap grace\" and \"costly grace.\" Although God\'s grace has been given freely to humans who do not deserve it, Bonhoeffer believed it rightly could be called \"costly grace\" because it cost our Lord Jesus Christ even the suffering of death. Some men and women have actually turned God\'s grace into lasciviousness. They do not know what the word grace means&mdash;that God gives us out of His rich and full goodness although we are unworthy of it. When I preach about the grace of God and point out that Jesus commanded us to take up our cross and follow Him, those who do not know the meaning of grace respond: \"Oh, Tozer is now preaching legalism.\"','Hebrews 13:9, 25','For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace . . . grace be with you all.

I will never be through talking about the union of the soul with the Savior, the conscious union of the believer\'s heart with Jesus. Remember, I am not talking about a \"theological union\" only. I am speaking also of a conscious union, a union that is felt and experienced. I have never been ashamed to tell my congregations that I believe in feelings. I surely believe in what Jonathan Edwards termed \"religious affections.\" That is man\'s perspective. I am aware also that from God\'s perspective there are qualities in the Divine Being that can only be known by the heart; never by the intellect! Long ago, John wrote: \"Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us\" (1 John 3:16). So it is best for us to confess that as humans we have difficulty in understanding what God has said when He says that He loves us!','1 John 5:20','We are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.','We have difficulty in understanding what God has said when He says that He loves us.','Lord, I do not claim to understand how You could want to be united with a man like me, but I cherish the fact that You do.'),(103,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Dealing With Sin','Many evangelical teachers insist so strongly upon free, unconditional grace as to create the impression that sin is not a serious matter and that God cares very little about it! They make it seem that God is only concerned with our escaping the consequences. The gospel then, in practical application, means little more than a way to escape the fruits of our past! But the heart that has felt the weight of its own sin and has seen the dread whiteness of the Most High God will never believe that a message of forgiveness without transformation is a message of good news. To remit a man\'s past without transforming his present is to violate the moral sincerity of his own heart. To that kind of thing God will be no party! For to offer a sinner the gift of salvation based upon the work of Christ, while at the same time allowing him to retain the idea that the gift carries with it no moral implications, is to do him untold injury where it hurts him most!','Romans 6:23','For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life.','To remit a man\'s past without transforming his present is to violate the moral sincerity of his own heart.','Lord, let me remember now the incredible cost of the grace You so freely give, and remind me always of the death that must daily take place in my life so that I may truly live.'),(104,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Love Without Measure','I once wrote something about how God loves us and how dear we are to Him. I was not sure I should put it down on paper, but God knows what I meant. I wrote, \"The only eccentricity that I can discover in the heart of God is the fact that a God such as He is should love sinners such as we are!\" On this earth, a mother will love the son who has betrayed her and shamed her and is now on his way to a life in prison. That seems to be a natural thing for a mother. But there is nothing natural about this love of God. It is a divine thing. It is forced out by the inward pressure within the heart of the God of all grace. That is why He waits for us, puts up with us, desires to lead us on&mdash;He loves us! My brethren, this should be our greatest encouragement in view of all that we know about ourselves: God loves us without measure, and He is so keenly interested in our spiritual growth and progress that He stands by in faithfulness to teach and instruct and discipline us as His own dear children!','Jeremiah 31:3','Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love.','The only eccentricity that I can discover in the heart of God is the fact that a God such as He is should love sinners such as we are!','Dear Lord, Thank You so much for love so extreme that, to me, it seems so unnatural.

When the Word was made flesh, there was no compromise on God\'s part! It is plain in the ancient Athanasian Creed that the early church fathers were cautious at this point of doctrine. They would not allow us to believe that God, in the Incarnation, became flesh by a coming down of the Deity into flesh, but rather by the taking of mankind into God. That is the wonder of redemption! In the past, the mythical gods of the nations were not strangers to compromise. But the holy God who is God, our heavenly Father, could never compromise Himself! He remained ever God and everything else remained not God. That gulf still existed even after Jesus Christ had become man and dwelt among us. This much, then, we can know about the acts of God&mdash;He will never back out of His bargain. This amazing union of man with God is effected unto perpetuity!','Colossians 2:9','For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.','The living God did not degrade Himself in the Incarnation. When the Word was made flesh, there was no compromise on God\'s part!','Lord, I am amazed, and do not claim to understand how You could take on the form of man and yet still be completely yourself.

But just as certainly, all that men can know of God in this life is revealed in Jesus Christ! When the apostle Paul said with yearning, \"That I may know Him,\" he was not speaking of intellectual knowledge. Paul was speaking of the reality of an experience of knowing God personally and consciously, spirit touching spirit and heart touching heart. We know that people spend a lot of time talking about a deeper Christian life, but few seem to want to know and love God for Himself. The precious fact is that God is the deeper life! Jesus Christ Himself is the deeper life, and as I plunge on into the knowledge of the triune God, my heart moves on into the blessedness of His fellowship. This means that there is less of me and more of God&mdash;thus, my spiritual life deepens, and I am strengthened in the knowledge of His will!','2 Corinthians 2:14','Thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ.','All that men can know of God in this life is revealed in Jesus Christ!','Lord, let me decrease that You may increase.

However, the Lord Himself has promised that as far as He is concerned, He is willing to keep the candles of my soul brightly burning! So, my heart tells me to ignore the modern scribes whose interpretations are forcing the Spirit, the blessed Dove, to fold His wings and be silent. I turn rather to one of Dr. A.B. Simpson&lsquo;s hymns rarely sung now, probably because very few believers have this experience of which he wrote: I take the hand of love divine; I count each precious promise mine. With this eternal countersign I take, He undertakes! I take Thee, blessed Lord, I give myself to Thee; and Thou, according to Thy Word, dost undertake for me!','Ephesians 5:6','Let no man deceive you with vain words.','The Lord Himself has promised that as far as He is concerned, He is willing to keep the candles of my soul brightly burning!','Lord, thank You for giving Yourself to me more than I could ever understand, and thank you undertaking for me.'),(108,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Explore God\'s Word','What a strange paradox!

Strange indeed that some humans have the idea that the Word of God can only be approached with shivering fears. But that is true only of those who love their sin and hate their Savior. The blessed truth is that if I hate my sin and love my Savior, the Word of God is a wonderful revelation indeed and a trustworthy guide. We need to be aware always that if we do not keep the Word of God on our side, we will be miserable in our souls continually. It is up to us. What do we sincerely will to do with God and His revealed Word? Years ago, the saintly George Mueller said he had read the Bible hundreds of times, and then he added, &ldquo;with meditation!&rdquo; Let us see to it that we read the Word. More than that, we should actually explore it!','Psalm 119:11','Thy word have I hid in mine heart.','The blessed truth is that if I hate my sin and love my Savior, the Word of God is a wonderful revelation indeed and a trustworthy guide.','Lord, thank You for Your Holy Bible.

A second fact is that men and women are saved by faith in Christ alone, without works and without our merit. However, the fact that Christ came to save sinners is not enough; that fact in itself cannot save us. Now in our day, the issues of believing faith and the gift of eternal life are clouded and confused by an &ldquo;easy acceptance&rdquo; that has been fatal to millions who may have stopped short in matters of faith and obedience. Faith is believing and receiving as in Acts 16:31: &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved;&rdquo; and in John 1:12: &ldquo;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe in his name.&rdquo;','Romans 10:13','For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.','Faith is believing and receiving.','Lord, I am so thankful that You chose in Your own wonderful way to save me, and I pray that the choice I made to serve You will be evident to those I would hope to win for You.'),(110,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Salvation\'s Price','Too many Christian leaders, acting like enthusiastic promoters, are teaching that the essence of faith is this: &ldquo;Come to Jesus&mdash;it will cost you nothing! The price has all been paid&mdash;it will cost you nothing!&rdquo; Brethren, that is a dangerous half-truth. There is always a price connected with salvation and with discipleship. God&rsquo;s grace is free, no doubt about that. No one in the wide world can make any human payment towards the plan of salvation or the forgiveness of sins. I take issue on Bible grounds with the statement that &ldquo;Everyone in the world has faith; all you have to do is turn your faith loose.&rdquo; That is truly a misconception of what the Bible teaches about men and God and faith. Actually, faith is a rare and wonderful plant that lives and grows only in the penitent soul. The teaching that every one has faith is simply a form of humanism in the guise of Christianity. I warn you that any faith that belongs to everybody is not the faith that saves. It is not that faith which is a gift of God to the broken and contrite heart!','Hebrews 11:6','But without faith it is impossible to please him.','The teaching that every one has faith is simply a form of humanism in the guise of Christianity.','Lord, may my faith grow stronger with the realization of how special it really is.'),(111,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','God\'s Faithful Voice','In a day when judgments are soon to come upon the earth, often doctors warn that we eat too much and worry too much.

In our self-centered lives, even those who are professing believers are prone to think they will hear the trumpets of woe in time to do something about all this. But at that time, it will be too late! The voice of God is a quiet voice. The voice of God&rsquo;s love and grace is constant-never strident, never compulsive. God has sent His messengers to every generation. He has spoken urgently and faithfully through His prophets, through the concerns of preachers and evangelists, and even through the sweet voices of gospel singers. Further, God has spoken through witnessing men and women&mdash;plain, sincere, loving men and women transformed by a spiritual birth from above. This is the voice of God we hear in this day of grace&mdash;the voice of the Savior calling wandering sinners home.','Luke 21:34','And take heed to yourselves . . . and cares of this life.','The voice of God is a quiet voice.

Scarcely anyone catches the imperious note in the words spoken by Jesus Christ. The invitational element of the Christian message has been pressed far out of proportion in the total scriptural scene. Christ with His lantern, His apologetic stance and His weak pleading face has taken the place of the true Son of Man whom John saw&mdash;His eyes as a flame of fire, His feet like burnished brass, and His voice as the sound of many waters. Only the Holy Spirit can reveal our Lord as He really is, and He does not paint in oils. He manifests Christ to the human spirit, not to our physical eyes. These are strenuous times, and men and women are being recruited to devote themselves to one or another master. But anything short of complete devotion to Christ is inadequate and must end in futility and loss.','Revelation 1:13, 16','One like unto the Son of man . . . out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword.','Only the Holy Spirit can reveal our Lord as He really is, and He does not paint in oils.

But by its very nature, it is of secondary importance for religion lies in the will and so does righteousness. God never intended that such a being as mankind should become the mere plaything of his or her feelings. The only good that God recognizes is the willed good. The only valid holiness is a willed holiness. That is why I am always a little suspicious of the overly bubbly Christian who talks too much about himself or herself and not enough about Jesus. That is also why I am more than a little concerned about the professing Christian whose experience does not seem to have resulted in a true inner longing to be more like Jesus every day in thought, word, and deed!','2 Corinthians 10:5','Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.','We know that the emotional life is a proper and noble part of our total personality.

They said that He was royal and gracious. They described Him as a mysterious being, and yet they noted His meekness. The meekness was His humanity. The majesty was His deity. You find them everlastingly united in Him. So meek that He nursed at His mother&rsquo;s breast, cried like any baby, and needed the same human care that every child needs. But He was also God, and in His majesty He stood before Herod and Pilate. When He returns, coming down from the sky, it will be in His majesty, the majesty of God; yet it will be in the majesty of the Man who is God! This is our Lord Jesus Christ. Before His foes He stands in majesty.

If Christianity is known only as a religious institution, it may well become merely a legalistic system of religion, and the hope of eternal life becomes a delusion. I have said this much about reality and assurance to counter the shock you may feel when I add that God wants to fully prepare you in your daily Christian life so that you will be ready indeed for heaven! Many of us have been in God&rsquo;s household for a long time. Remember that God has been trying to do something special within our beings day after day, year after year. Why?

They regarded this earth as the dressing room to outfit themselves for heaven. The evangelical church has come through a period when nearly everyone has believed that there is just one prerequisite to readiness&mdash;being born again. We have made being born again almost like receiving a pass to a special event; when Jesus returns we whip out the pass to prove our readiness. Frankly, I do not think it will be like that. I do not believe that all professed believers are automatically ready to meet the Lord. Our Savior Himself was joined by Peter, John, and Paul in warning and pleading that we should live, watch, and pray so to be ready for Jesus&rsquo; coming.','1 Peter 4:7','The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.','Our pious forefathers believed in spiritual preparation, and they said so.','Lord, I am not so pious as I might be.

I did not have the privilege of growing up in a home where Christ was known and loved. God spoke to me through a street preacher who quoted the words of Jesus, &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; That invitation let me know that Jesus is still calling &ldquo;Come now!&rdquo; I went home and up into the attic. There in earnest prayer, I gave my heart and life to Jesus Christ. My feet had taken me home and into the attic. But it was my heart that went to Jesus! Within my heart I consented to go to Jesus.

To avoid the necessity of either obeying or rejecting the plain instruction of our Lord in the New Testament, we take refuge in a liberal interpretation of them. We find ways to avoid the sharp point of obedience, comfort carnality, and make the words of Christ of none effect. And the essence of it all is that &ldquo;Christ simply could not have meant what He said.&rdquo; Dare we admit that His teachings are accepted even theoretically only after they have been weakened by &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; ?

There he will also find the best arena for the largest exercise of those gifts and powers with which God may have endowed him. Unfortunately, the word &ldquo;church&rdquo; has taken on meanings, which it did not originally have. The meaning of the word for the true Christian was fixed by our Lord and His apostles, and no man or angel has authority to change it!

That is the way with biography: the very word itself suggests it, for it comes from bios, life, and graphein&mdash;to write&mdash;and means the written history of a person&rsquo;s life. So says Noah Webster. Now when we look at the gospels, we note an odd and wonderful thing. An extra chapter is added. Why? Biography, by its own definition, must confine itself to the record of the life of an individual. That part of the book that deals with the family tree is not biography but history, and the part that follows the record of the subject&rsquo;s death is not biography either. It may be appraisal, or eulogy, or criticism, but not biography, for the reason that the &ldquo;bios&rdquo; is gone: the subject is dead. The part that tells of his death is properly the last chapter. The only place in world literature where this order is broken is in the four gospels. They record the story of the man Jesus from birth to death and end like every other book of biography has ended since the art of writing was invented. . . . They all agree: Jesus was dead. The life about which they had been writing was gone. The biography was ended. Then, for the only time in this history of human thought, a biographer adds to his book a new section that is authentic biography and begins to write a chapter to follow the last chapter.','1 Corinthians 15:17-18','And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.','If Christ had not risen from that tomb of death our faith and that of millions of believers over the centuries would be utterly futile. There would be no hope, absolutely none.','O Risen Christ, my faith looks up to You. Because You live, so may I. Hallelujah!'),(124,'The Next Chapter after the Last','One','The Next Chapter after the Last','2','The Chapter after the Last','Matthew says, &ldquo;And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb.&rdquo; Mark says, &ldquo;And he [Joseph] bought fine linen, and took him [Jesus] down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher, which was hewn out of a rock.&rdquo; Luke writes, &ldquo;And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.&rdquo; John says, &ldquo;. . . There was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre . . . There laid they Jesus.&rdquo; They all agree: Jesus was dead. The life about which they had been writing was gone; the biography was ended. Then for the only time in this history of human thought, a biographer adds to his book a new section, which is authentic biography and begins to write a chapter to follow the last chapter. This time the story did not end with a funeral. The Subject, whose story should have ended at death, was once again back among men to challenge new writers to try to find enough paper and enough ink to write the rest of the story of the life that can never end. Whatever is written of Him now is written of a living man. He was dead, but He is alive forevermore.','Romans 6:4','We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.','What if Christ had not risen? That demonstration of His post-resurrection power would be absent. Those promises of His unfulfilled&mdash;the coming of the Holy Spirit, the presence of Christ with us, His intercession for us, His coming again.','Forgive me, Lord, for failure to live in the experience of Your resurrection power. You declare that I died with You and may know new life just as You were raised from the dead.'),(125,'The Next Chapter after the Last','One','The Next Chapter after the Last','3','The Period Becomes a Comma','He was dead, but He is alive forevermore. That such a thing could be was intimated by the miracles of restoration which our Lord performed during His earthly ministry. The widow&rsquo;s son was brought back to life for a brief time; at our Lord&rsquo;s gentle call, Jairus&rsquo;s little daughter rose from her bed of death; and Lazarus, at Christ&rsquo;s command, came forth bound hand and foot. These were but vague disclosures of what was to come, and were at best only temporary suspensions of the inexorable law, which demands that death shall always follow life&mdash;death complete and final. For these, all died again, and the rule of biography was upheld. Each ended in a sepulcher at last. And that sepulcher was the period at the end of the last chapter. What a perpetual wonder it is, then, that the biography of Jesus had to be resumed. Luke added not merely another chapter, but a whole book. The book of Acts was a logical necessity. &ldquo;He showed himself alive after his passion,&rdquo; writes Luke. The rest of the New Testament gives us some idea of what He is doing now, and prophecy reveals a little of what He will be doing through the ages to come.','John 11:44','The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\"','What was it like for Lazarus to be dead four days and then be raised to life again? Did he want to return? There is nothing recorded concerning Lazarus after that experience. The period became a comma. Lazarus would die again, but he would be raised forever.','Thank You, Father, that, for the believer, the period becomes a comma. From here we go home through Christ. Amen!'),(126,'The Next Chapter after the Last','One','The Next Chapter after the Last','4','The Unending Chapter','That next chapter after the last is the source of all the Christian&rsquo;s hope, for it assures us that our Lord has put death in its place and has delivered us from the ancient curse. Death did not end the activities of our Lord; it did not even interrupt them, for while His body lay in Joseph&rsquo;s new tomb, He was preaching to the spirits in prison (1 Peter 3:18-20). And after three days, His spirit was reunited with His body and the new chapter began, the chapter that can have no ending. Had Christ not risen from the dead, His life, beautiful as it was, would have been a human tragedy. Since He did in fact rise, His life has been shown to be an unrelieved triumph. The blood, the pain, the rejection, the agony of dying, the cold, stiff body and the colder tomb&mdash;these belong to the former days. The days that are now are days of hope and life and everlasting freedom. What is true of Christ is true also of all who believe in Him. How many saints since New Testament times have lived and hoped and labored and worshiped, only to grow old and bent and to drop at last, weak and helpless, into the open grave. If that was for them the end, then we Christians would be of all men most miserable. But it was not the end. For all of God&rsquo;s true children there will be another chapter, a chapter that will begin with the resurrection and go on as long as eternity endures.','1 Corinthians 15:20','But Christ indeed has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.','Relatively little is revealed in Scripture concerning the believer&rsquo;s life in heaven. Are we not able to grasp what it will be like? We have little or nothing in human experience that qualifies as an accurate simile.','My only hope for life in that unending chapter is You, O Christ. You are the first fruit. We are those that follow!'),(127,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Two','Quality versus Quantity','5','The Psychology of Impermanence','Time may show that one of the greatest weaknesses in our modern civilization has been the acceptance of quantity rather than quality as the goal after which to strive. This is particularly evident in the United States. Costly buildings are constantly being erected with no expectation that they shall last more than one short generation. Not only in our architecture but almost everywhere else is this psychology of impermanence found. A beauty salon ad recently defined a term that has long needed clarification. It read: &ldquo;Permanent Waves. Guaranteed to last three months.&rdquo; So, permanence is the quality of lasting three months! These may be extreme cases, but they illustrate the transiency of men&rsquo;s hopes and the brevity of their dreams apart from God. The church also is suffering from a left-handed acceptance of this philosophy of impermanence. Christianity is resting under the blight of degraded values. And it all stems from a too-eager desire to impress, to gain fleeting attention, to appear well in comparison with some world-beater who happens for the time to have the ear or the eye of the public. This is so foreign to the Scriptures that we wonder how Bible-loving Christians can be deceived by it. The Word of God ignores size and quantity and lays all its stress upon quality. Christ, more than any other man, was followed by the crowds, yet after giving them such help as they were able to receive, He quietly turned from them and deposited His enduring truths in the breasts of His chosen 12. He refused a quick shortcut to the throne and chose instead the long painful way of the cross. He rejected the offers of the multitude and rested His success upon those eternal qualities, which He was able to plant in the hearts of a modest number of redeemed men. The ages have thanked God that He did.','Acts 9:31','Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria&mdash;enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.','Quantity growth of the church is noted at least nine times in Acts 2-9. Occasionally specific numbers are given. But quality is not sacrificed for quantity. Spirit-filled witnesses, healings, and miracles characterize the growing, first-century church.','Lord, give discernment to our church leaders so that they are deceived neither by growth in numbers nor desperate clinging to decline and methods of the past. May their eyes be focused on the primary goal of Spirit-filled living.'),(128,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Two','Quality versus Quantity','6','The Contemporary vs. the Eternal','Pastors and churches in our hectic times are harassed by the temptation to seek size at any cost and to secure by inflation what they cannot gain by legitimate growth. The mixed multitude cries for quantity and will not forgive a minister who insists upon solid values and permanence. Many a man of God is being subjected to cruel pressure by the ill-taught members of his flock who scorn his slow methods and demand quick results and a popular following, regardless of quality. These children play in the marketplaces and cannot overlook the affront we do them by our refusal to dance when they whistle or to weep when they out of caprice pipe a sad tune. They are greedy for thrills, and since they dare no longer seek them in the theater, they demand to have them brought into the church. We who follow Christ are men and women of eternity. We must put no confidence in the passing scenes of the disappearing world. We must resist every attempt of Satan to palm off upon us the values that belong to mortality. Nothing less than forever is long enough for us. We view with amused sadness the frenetic scramble of the world to gain a brief moment in the sun. &ldquo;The book of the month,&rdquo; for instance, has a strange sound to one who has dwelt with God and taken His values from the Ancient of Days. &ldquo;The man of the year&rdquo; cannot impress those men and women who are making their plans for that long eternity when days and years have passed away and time is no more.','Psalm 119:105','Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.','Contemporary and eternal: are they compatible? The challenge is to recognize and communicate the eternal without contemporary or traditional forms letting in syncretistic or current worldview error.','Father, Your Word is my light along the way, keeping me from the momentary popular or the hoary traditional. Increase my sensitivity to perceive Your light, in Jesus&rsquo; name.'),(129,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Two','Quality versus Quantity','7','Growing Oaks or Ears of Popcorn','The church must claim again her ancient dowry of everlastingness. She must begin again to deal with ages and millenniums rather than with days and years. She must not count numbers but test foundations. She must work for permanence rather than for appearance. Her children must seek those enduring things that have been touched with immortality. The shallow brook of popular religion chatters on its nervous way and thinks the ocean too quiet and dull because it lies deep in its mighty bed and is unaffected by the latest shower. Faith in one of its aspects moves mountains; in another it gives patience to see the promises afar and to wait quietly for their fulfillment. Insistence upon an immediate answer to every request of the soul is an evidence of religious infantilism. It takes God longer to grow an oak than to grow an ear of popcorn. It will cost something to walk slow in the parade of the ages while excited men of time rush about confusing motion with progress. But it will pay in the long run—and the true Christian is not much interested in anything short of that.','Genesis 15:6','Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.','Abraham believed God and kept on believing God. He waited 25 years for the birth of Isaac. In his lifetime, Abraham never saw the emergence of the people Israel or experienced possession of the Promised Land. He just believed and kept on believing. ','Father, You are everlasting. You are forever. Help me to trustfully walk with You through the valleys and over the mountains. I want to be an oak.'),(130,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Three','We Must Stay by the Majors','8','Concentrating on Things that Really Matter','In the Christian life we find this pattern repeated: a few important things and a world of burdensome but unimportant ones. The Spirit-taught Christian must look past the multiplicity of incidental things and find the few that really matter. And let it be repeated for our encouragement, they are few in number and surprisingly easy to identify. The Scriptures make perfectly clear what they are: the fact of God, the Person and work of Christ, faith and obedience, hope, and love. These, along with a few more, constitute the essence of the truth, which we must know and love. Christ summed up the moral law as love to God and man. Salvation He made to rest upon faith in God and in the One whom He had sent. Paul simplified the wonders of the spiritual life in the words, &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; The temptation to forget the few spiritual essentials and to go wandering off after unimportant things is very strong, especially to Christians of a certain curious type of mind. Such persons find the great majors of the faith of our fathers altogether too tame for them. Their souls loathe that light bread; their appetites crave the gamy tang of fresh-killed meat. They take great pride in their reputation as being mighty hunters before the Lord, and any time we look out we may see them returning from the chase with some new mystery hanging limply over their shoulder. Usually the game they bring down is something on which there is a biblical closed season&mdash;some vague hint in the Scriptures, some obscure verse about which the translators disagree, some marginal note for which there is not much scholarly authority&mdash;these are their favorite meat. They are especially skillful at propounding notions, which have never been a part of the Christian heritage of truth. Their enthusiasm mounts with the uncertainty of their position, and their dogmatism grows firmer in proportion to the mystery that surrounds their subject.','2 Timothy 3:7','. . . always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.','Seizing upon minor issues and becoming engrossed in details can be an excuse for failure to live the unmistakable truth.','O God, You are the Light. The closer I come to You the more clearly the dark holes of my heart are exposed. Shine on me and burn away the dross, for Christ&rsquo;s sake. Amen.'),(131,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Three','We Must Stay by the Majors','9','Heart Health Food or Just Tasty Snacks','Dr. Samuel Johnson, the famous English sage, once said that one of the surest evidences of intellectual immaturity is the desire to startle people. Yet there are Christians who have been fed upon the odd, the strange and the curious so long and so exclusively that they have become wholly unfitted spiritually to receive or to appreciate sound doctrine. They live to be startled by something new or thrilled by something wonderful. They will believe anything so long as it is just a little away from the time-honored beliefs of sober Christian men. A serious discourse calling for repentance, humbleness of mind, and holiness of life is impatiently dismissed as old-fashioned, dull, and lacking in &ldquo;audience appeal.&rdquo; Yet these things are just the ones that rank highest on the list of things we need to hear, and by them we shall be judged in that great day of Christ. A church fed on excitement is no New Testament church at all. The desire for surface stimulation is a sure mark of the fallen nature, the very thing Christ died to deliver us from. A curious crowd of baptized &ldquo;worldlings&rdquo; waiting each Sunday for the quasi-religious needle to give them a lift bears no relation whatsoever to a true assembly of Christian believers. That its members protest their undying faith in the Bible does not change things any. &ldquo;Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.&rdquo;','Acts 2:42&ndash;43','They devoted themselves to the apostles&rsquo; teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders performed by the apostles.','Is the &ldquo;apostles&rsquo; teaching&rdquo; still at the heart of our worship services, or do we feature the more interesting storytelling and Christian entertainment? Perhaps it is the Spirit&rsquo;s power demonstrated in some wonders and miraculous signs we need.','Lord, give me a hunger for the solid food that feeds the heart and a holy dissatisfaction with anything less.'),(132,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Three','We Must Stay by the Majors','10','Staying with the Clear Teaching of Scripture','Every believer, as well as every minister of Christ, must decide whether he will put his emphasis upon the majors or the minors. He must decide whether he will stay by the sober truths, which constitute the beating heart of the Scriptures, or turn his attention to those marginal doctrines that always bring division and, at their best, could not help us much on our way to the Celestial City. No man has any moral right to propound any teaching about which there is not full agreement among Bible Christians until he has made himself familiar with Church history and with the development of Christian doctrine through the centuries. The historic approach is best. After we have discovered what holy men believed, what great reformers and saints taught, what the purest souls and mightiest workers held to be important for holy living and dying—then we are in a fair position to appraise our own teaching. Humility is the only state of mind in which to approach the Scriptures. The Spirit will teach the humble soul those things that make for his salvation and for a holy walk and fruitful service here below. Little else matters.','1 Corinthians 4:6','Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, \"Do not go beyond what is written.\" Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other.','There is the danger of embellishing the written, even ranging beyond it, in order to serve up the new, the exotic, the innovative. Oh, for preachers who open to us the meat of God&rsquo;s Word with contextual accuracy, clarity, sound exegesis, and meaningful application.','Thank You for access to Your Word, Lord. There are many in the world without the Word in their language. May I receive it and live it to Your glory. Amen.'),(133,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Four','Complaining: A Disease of the Soul','11','The Illogic of Complaining','Among those sins most exquisitely fitted to injure the soul and destroy the testimony, few can equal the sin of complaining. Yet the habit is so widespread that we hardly notice it among us. The complaining heart never lacks for occasion. It can always find reason enough to be unhappy. The object of its censure may be almost anything: the weather, the church, the difficulties of the way, other Christians, or even God Himself. A complaining Christian puts himself in a position morally untenable. The simple logic of his professed discipleship is against him with an unanswerable argument. Its reasoning runs like this: First, he is a Christian because he chose to be. There are no conscripts in the army of God. He is, therefore, in the awkward position of complaining against the very conditions he brought himself into by his own free choice. Secondly, he can quit any time he desires. No Christian wears a chain on his leg. Yet he still continues on, grumbling as he goes; and for such conduct he has no defense.','Philippians 2:14&ndash;15','Do everything without complaining or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation.','The cause for complaint is often a God-given opportunity for growth and praise. What at first appear to be thorns may prove to be divine prods that move us closer to God.','Deliver me from complaining, Lord. Rather, teach me to praise You and thank You for the opportunities to grow.'),(134,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Four','Complaining: A Disease of the Soul','12','Costs of Complaining','The moral company in which he finds himself further embarrasses the complainer. His is a spiritual affinity with some pretty shady characters: Cain, Korah, the sulky elder brother, the petulant Jews of the Book of Malachi who answered every fatherly admonition of God with an ill-humored \"Wherefore have we? Wherein have we?\" These are but a few faces that stand out in the picture of the disgruntled followers of the religious way. And the complaining Christian, if he but looks closely, will see his own face peering out at him from the background. Lastly, the believer who complains against the difficulties of the way proves that he has never felt or known the sorrows which broke over the head of Christ when He was here among men. After one look at Gethsemane or Calvary, the Christian can never again believe that his own path is a hard one. We dare not compare our trifling pains with the sublime passion endured for our salvation. Any comparison would itself be the supreme argument against our complaints, for what sorrow is like unto His? After saying all this, we are yet sure that no one can be reasoned out of the habit of complaining. That habit is more than a habit&mdash;it is a disease of the soul, and as such, it will never yield to mere logic. The only cure is cleansing in the blood of the Lamb.','Numbers 16:1&ndash;2','Korah son of Izhar, the sons of Kohath, . . . and certain Reubenites . . . became insolent and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.','Korah and members of the council challenged Moses&rsquo; leadership. They experienced God&rsquo;s judgment as a result. Are there churches experiencing God&rsquo;s judgment because of grumbling and complaint against God-appointed leaders? ','Lord, I find it far easier to grumble and complain against leaders than to graciously submit to them. May I faithfully pray for my leaders.'),(135,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Five','The Duty of Opposing','13','Daring to Stand for Truth','The nearer we draw to the heart of God the less taste we will have for controversy. The peace we know in God&rsquo;s bosom is so sweet that it is but natural that we want to keep it unbroken to enjoy as fully and as long as possible. The Spirit-filled Christian is never a good fighter. He is at too many disadvantages. The enemy is always better at invective than he will allow himself to be. The devil has all the picturesque epithets, and his followers have no conscience about using them. The Christian is always more at home blessing than he is opposing. He is, moreover, much thinner-skinned than his adversaries. He shrinks from an angry countenance and draws back from bitter words. They are symbols of a world he has long ago forsaken for the quiet of the kingdom of God, where love and good will prevail. All this is in his favor, for it marks him out as a man in whom there is no hate and who earnestly desires to live at peace with all men. In spite of his sincere longing for peace, however, there will be times when he dare not allow himself to enjoy it. There are times when it is a sin to be at peace. There are circumstances when there is nothing to do but to stand up and vigorously oppose. To wink at iniquity for the sake of peace is not a proof of superior spirituality; it is rather a sign of a reprehensible timidity, which dare not oppose sin for fear of the consequences. For it will cost us heavily to stand for the right when the wrong is in the majority, which is 100 percent of the time.','2 Thessalonians 2:15','So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.','It is easier to excuse ourselves from religious conflict than to assert the truth in a Spirit-emboldened manner. But there are times when we are God&rsquo;s strategically placed person; we speak and live as His representatives.','Lord, You know that my inclination is to flee from controversy and confrontation. Oh Lord, show me when to confront and enable me to do it for Christ&rsquo;s sake.'),(136,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Five','The Duty of Opposing','14','Standing for Truth','In recent times, we have developed a peace-loving, soft-spoken, tame and harmless brand of Christian of whom the world has no fear and for whom it has little respect. We are careful, for instance, never to speak in public against any of the false cults lest we be thought intolerant. We fear to talk against the destructive sins of modern civilization for fear someone will brand us as bigoted and narrow. Little by little we have been forced off the hard earth into a religious &ldquo;cloud-land,&rdquo; where we are permitted to wing our harmless way around like swallows at sundown, saying nothing that might stir the ire of the sons of this world. That neo-Christianity, which seems for the time to be the most popular (and is certainly the most aggressive), is very careful not to oppose sin. It wins its crowds by amusing them and its converts by hiding from them the full implications of the Christian message. It carries on its projects after the ballyhoo methods of American business. Well might we paraphrase Wordsworth and cry, &ldquo;Elijah, thou shouldst be living at this hour; America has need of thee.&rdquo; We stand in desperate need of a few men like Elijah who will dare to face up to the brazen sinners who dictate our every way of life. Sin in the full proportions of a revolution or a plague has all but destroyed our civilization while church people have played like children in the marketplace. What has happened to the spirit of the American Christian? Has our gold become dim? Have we lost the spirit of discernment till we can no longer recognize our captors? How much longer will we hide in caves while Ahab and Jezebel continue to pollute the temple and ravage the land? Surely, we should give this some serious thought and prayer before it is too late&mdash;if indeed it is not too late already.','Isaiah 59:15','Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice.','In our culture today there seem to be only two absolutes: (1) that there are no absolutes except that there are no absolutes; and (2) everything must be tolerated, since there is no absolute truth. As painful and uncomfortable as it is, we must stand up for God&rsquo;s truth.','Father, give me courage and boldness to lovingly and graciously stand for You in my sphere of influence. May I be Your ambassador.'),(137,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Six','Power Requires Separation','15','When Fish Catch the Fisherman','History shows clearly enough that true spirituality has never at any time been the possession of the masses. In any given period since the fall of the human race, only a few persons ever discerned the right way or walked in God\'s law. God\'s truth has never been popular. Wherever Christianity becomes popular, it is not on its way to die—it has already died. Popular Judaism slew the prophets and crucified Christ. Popular Christianity killed the Reformers, jailed the Quakers and drove John Wesley into the streets. When it comes to religion, the crowds are always wrong. At any time there are a few who see, and the rest are blinded. To stand by the truth of God against the current religious vogue is always unpopular and may be downright dangerous. The historic church, while she was a hated minority group, had a moral power that made her terrible to evil and invincible before her foes. When the Roman masses, without change of heart, were made Christian by baptism, Christianity gained popularity and lost her spiritual glow. From there she went on to adopt the ways of Rome and to follow her pagan religions. The fish caught the fisherman, and what started out to be the conversion of Rome became finally the conversion of the church. From that ignominious captivity the church has never been fully delivered.','John 15:19','If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.','That the world hates us because we are disciples of Christ is a positive indication that we are indeed following Him. If the world welcomes us as disciples of Christ, alarms go off. How closely are we walking with Him?','Lord, help me to express Your love to the people of the world without conforming to the world.'),(138,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Six','Power Requires Separation','16','In the World But Not of It','We are sent to bless the world, but never are we told to compromise with it. Our glory lies in a spiritual withdrawal from all that builds on dust. The bee finds no honey while crawling around the hive. Honey is in the flower far away, where there is quiet and peace and the sun and the flowing stream; there the bee must go to find it. The Christian will find slim pickings where professed believers play and pray all in one breath. He may be compelled sometimes to travel alone or at least to go with the ostracized few. To belong to the despised minority may be the price he must pay for power. But power is cheap at any price.','John 17:14&ndash;16','I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.','In the world but not of the world is a distinction often difficult to maintain. God&rsquo;s enablement is the only means.','Oh Lord, may I experience Your power to be in the world but not of it. May I be light to it for Jesus&rsquo; sake. Amen.'),(139,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Seven','The Right Direction Is Forward!','17','Making the Most of Today','We have little sympathy for the psychology expressed in the various &ldquo;Back To&rdquo; movements among Christians today. Our direction is not back but forward. Few acts are as futile as sitting down and singing &ldquo;Backward, turn backward, O Time, in thy flight.&rdquo; We cannot turn the clock back. We cannot bring back better days. And it is not necessary or desirable that we should. If by means of some fantastic &ldquo;time machine&rdquo; one of us were permitted to go backward and visit some favorite period of the past, he would in all probability find the experience extremely disappointing. He would find himself a kind of anachronism, wholly out of place and thoroughly unhappy. To each one it is given to occupy his spot in history. He, like David, must do the will of God by serving his generation. It is in his own day that he must meet God in satisfying encounter. It is in his today, not in some pensive yesterday, that he must explore the riches of divine grace, do his allotted work, and win his crown. Psychologists attribute certain abnormal mental conditions to an unconscious desire to escape the responsibilities of adult life by returning to the quiet and security of the prenatal state. Our habit of trying to recapture the spiritual glow of some better time by going backward creates a suspicion that we have lost the will to fight and are retiring to a safer spot behind the lines, where we can sit down in peace to dream of armies defeated and battles won.','Psalm 118:24','This is the day the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.','Today is an opportunity to know God and to serve Him. We no longer have yesterday and may have no tomorrows. Today is uniquely God-given.','My tendency, Lord, is to look back or forward. In doing so, I often miss the strategic value of today. Thank You for this day.'),(140,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Seven','The Right Direction Is Forward!','18','Let Us Draw Near Today','Today is our day. No one at any time has ever had any spiritual graces that we at this time cannot enjoy if we will meet the terms on which they are given. If these times are morally darker, they but provide a background against which we can shine the brighter. Our God is the God of today as well as of yesterday, and we may be sure that wherever our tomorrows may carry us, our faithful God will be with us as He was with Abraham and David and Paul. Those great men did not need us then, and we cannot have them with us now. Amen. So be it. And God be praised. We cannot have them, but we can have that which is infinitely better&mdash;we can have their God and Father, and we can have their Savior, and we can have the same blessed Holy Spirit that made them great.','Hebrews 10:22, 24','Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water ... And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.','The God of our mothers and fathers is with us. He is with us no less than He was with them. To Him we may draw near and by His Spirit encourage one another.','Thank You, Father, for the invitation to draw near to You. To get closer to You than I have ever been before. I come in Jesus&rsquo; name.'),(141,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Seven','The Right Direction Is Forward!','19','Let\'s Go On!','The will of God is always the proper goal for every one of us. Where God is must be the place of desire. Any motion toward God is a forward motion. Even repentance is not a retreat toward the past but a decided march into a more glorious future. Restitution is not a return to yesterday but a step into a blessed tomorrow. There is such a thing as going backward in the spiritual life. There is such a thing as a retreat from a spiritual position once held by us as individual Christians. And there is such a thing as denominations and missionary societies making a wholesale withdrawal from ground once won at tremendous cost. If we find that we have gone back, then we should immediately reverse the direction and again go forward. The great truths of superior spiritual experiences, of high levels of personal living, of rapturous communion with the three persons of the Godhead, of victory over the flesh, of the gifts and power of the Spirit&mdash;what has happened to these? Once they marked us out and made us peculiar. What about it today? These are fair questions, and they demand an answer. If candid self-examination reveals a departure from the green pastures where once our fathers grazed, what then? Let there be no wasting of time in a futile mooning over the past. Rather let us arise and go! Let us go forward to a new and better place in God. The land lies before us. Let us go in and take it.','Hebrews 6:1, 3','Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity ... And God permitting, we will do so.','Let&rsquo;s go on to maturity! Let&rsquo;s grow in Christ! Christ wants us to know Him, to experientially know Him. Let&rsquo;s make it our highest priority.','From Your Word, Lord, from the lives of Your people, I know there are bridges to cross and mountains to climb that take me deeper into You. I want to go on by Your Spirit!'),(142,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Eight','On the Public Reading of the Scriptures','20','Keeping the Message of the Bible Central','The Bible is the most important book in the world, and for Christians it is just about the only book&mdash;certainly the only book&mdash;that should claim the place of honor in the public worship of God. We are, we trust, duly grateful for every good spiritual book written since the close of the New Testament canon. We do not undervalue the devotional book or the carefully prepared theological work, but when saints meet in communion there should be but one book, the Bible. The place given to the Scriptures by the different churches may be learned from the very architecture of the building in which their congregations gather. The ritualistic church builds itself around the altar. Toward that altar all eyes are directed and around that altar various and sundry choirs are ranged to chant or respond or sing as the occasion may demand. The typical Protestant church is quite different. Its center of interest is the pulpit, and upon that pulpit rests a copy of the Bible printed in the language of the people. Preachers may come and preachers may go, but that old pulpit Bible remains. There it lies while generations pass, a source of light in the world&rsquo;s darkness, a fountain of pure water in the world&rsquo;s barren desert. And that minister is considered the best who can expound its sweet mysteries. Lack of oratorical gifts will be forgiven if the man of God will but open the Book and give his hearers to eat of the heavenly manna.','2 Timothy 2:15','Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.','The pulpit has been replaced by the small podium or just empty space. Preachers seem to walk miles around the platform. But the pulpit Bible remains a source of light in the world&rsquo;s darkness, a fountain of pure water in the world&rsquo;s barren desert.','Lord, may Your Word be central in our church services. May it be clearly and carefully presented so that we might grow.'),(143,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Eight','On the Public Reading of the Scriptures','21','The Word of God','Of course, we of this generation cannot know by firsthand experience how the Word of God was read in other times. But it would be hard to conceive of our fathers having done a poorer job than we do when it comes to the public reading of the Scriptures. Most of us read the Scriptures so badly that a good performance draws attention by its rarity. It could be argued that since everyone these days owns his own copy of the Scriptures, the need for the public reading of the Word is not as great as formerly. If that is true, then let us not bother to read the Scriptures at all in our churches. But if we are going to read the Word publicly, then it is incumbent upon us to read it well. A mumbled, badly articulated and unintelligent reading of the sacred Scriptures will do more than we think to give the listeners the idea that the Word is not important. We do not, however, concur in the belief that because the Word has attained such wide circulation we should not read it in our public meetings. We should by all means read it, and we should make the reading a memorable experience for those who hear. Every man who is honored with the leadership of public worship should learn to read well. And do not imagine that anyone who can read at all can read well. Even learned men break down here. We are all familiar with those public figures who talk fluently on almost any subject but flunk out miserably when they try to quote the Scriptures. Reading the Bible well is something not picked up overnight.','Nehemiah 8:3','He [Ezra] read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.','Ezra read the Book of the Law of Moses to the people from daybreak till noon. There was no public address system. Ezra must have read well. The people stood and listened attentively.','O God, help us to read Your Word well and to listen attentively, for it is Your Word.'),(144,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Eight','On the Public Reading of the Scriptures','22','Public Bible Reading as Part of Worship','To read the Bible well in public we must first love it. The voice, if it is free, unconsciously follows the emotional tone. Reverence cannot be simulated. No one who does not feel the deep solemnity of the Holy Word can properly express it. God will not allow His Book to become the plaything of the rhetorician. That is why we instinctively draw back from every simulated tone in the reading of the Scriptures. The radio announcer&rsquo;s artificial unction cannot hide the absence of the real thing. The man who stands to declaim the Scriptures like a schoolboy reciting a passage from Hamlet can only leave his hearers with a feeling of disappointment. They know they have been cheated, though most of them could not tell just how. Again, to read the Bible well, one must know what the words mean and allow them to mean just that, without putting any body English on the passage to make it take a turn of meaning not found in the text. Probably the hardest part of learning to read well is eliminating ourselves. We read best when we get ourselves out of the transaction and let God talk through the imperfect medium of our voice. The beginner should read aloud entire books of the Bible in the privacy of his own room. In that way he can learn to hear his own voice and will know how he sounds to others. Let him consult a pronouncing Bible to learn the correct pronunciations of the names and places of the Bible. Let him cultivate the habit of reading slowly and distinctly with the reverence and dignity proper to the subject matter. Surely Protestants deserve a better sort of Scripture reading than they are now getting in our churches. And we who do the reading are the only ones who can give it to them.','1 Timothy 4:13','Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.','Public reading of Scripture is closely related to preaching and teaching. Certainly, preaching and teaching need to be done well but so does the public reading of the Scripture. All are part of corporate church worship.','May we read Your Word from our hearts, Father, and may we listen with our hearts when we hear it read.'),(145,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Nine','The Spiritual Love of Jesus','23','Loving God and Our Neighbor','The whole of true religion can be summed up in the spiritual love of Jesus. To love God and to love our neighbor was said by our Lord to be the fulfilling of the law and the prophets. All Christians believe that God reveals Himself as Christ; so the love of Jesus is in truth the love of God. Love as experienced by human beings may be on either of two levels, the human or the divine. These are not the same. They differ not only in intensity and elevation but in kind. Human love is undoubtedly the best thing left to the human race. Though it is often perverted and sometimes degraded, it is still Adam&rsquo;s best product, and without it, life on earth would be unendurable. Let us imagine what the world would be like if every trace of human love were suddenly removed. The heart recoils from the contemplation of such a horror. Without love, earth would not differ from hell except for the difference of location. Let us treasure what is left of love among the sons of men. It is not perfect, but it makes life bearable and even sweet here below. But human love is not divine love and should never be confused with it. Among the sentimental religionists, the two are accepted as being the very same and no distinctions are made. This is a great moral blunder and one that leads to spiritual frustration and disappointment. If we are to think clearly and pray rightly, we must recognize the difference between love that is merely human and that other love which cometh down from above. Charles Wesley knew the difference and made it clear in his famous lines: Love divine, all loves excelling, joy of heaven, to earth come down. Here all grades and degrees of human love are acknowledged, and the true love that comes down from heaven is placed above them as far as the heaven is above the earth. This is not only good poetry but also it is good theology.','1 John 4:10&ndash;11','This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.','God&rsquo;s love for us is John 3:16 kind of love. It is only with God&rsquo;s love that we can love one another, not only the lovable but the terribly unlovable.','Your love, O God, is so deep, so wide. Grant increased understanding of it so that I may love others with Your love, in Christ&rsquo;s name.'),(146,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Nine','The Spiritual Love of Jesus','24','\"Spiritual\" Love','The human heart can love the human Jesus as it can love the human Lincoln, but the spiritual love of Jesus is something altogether different from and infinitely superior to the purest love the human heart can know. Indeed, it is not possible to love Jesus rightly except by the Holy Spirit. Only the third Person of the Trinity can love the second Person in a manner pleasing to the Father. The spiritual love of Jesus is nothing else but the Spirit in us loving Christ the Eternal Son. Christ, after the flesh, receives a great deal of fawning attention from the liberal and the modernist, but love that is not the outflow of the indwelling Holy Spirit is not true spiritual love and cannot be acceptable to God. We do Christ no honor when we do no more than to give Him the best of our human love. Even though we love Him better than we love any other man, still it is not enough if He merely wins first place in competition with Socrates or Walt Whitman. He is not rightly loved until He is loved as very God of very God, and the Spirit within us does the loving. There is much in present-day gospel circles that illustrates the distinction we are pointing out. A great many loud protestations of love for Christ leave the discerning heart with the impression that they are but sounding brass and tinkling cymbals. Innumerable sweet love ballads are sung to Jesus by persons who have never known the inward illumination of the Holy Spirit or felt the shock that comes with a true sight of the sinful pollution of nature.','John 21:16','Again Jesus said, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you truly love me?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;Take care of my sheep.&rdquo;','The love Christ asks of us is not the sentimental kind with emotional outbursts tearfully expressed. Love for Him is expressed in loving His sheep, releasing to people the love of Christ produced by the indwelling Spirit.','Father, teach me to love with that love that is part of the fruit of the Spirit produced in me as I walk daily by the Spirit. That is spiritual love.'),(147,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Nine','The Spiritual Love of Jesus','25','Meaningful Love','While the all-important distinction between the human and the spiritual love of Jesus is one that must be discerned, and one which can scarcely be explained, we yet venture to point out some marks that may distinguish the two. Reverence will always be present in the heart of the one who loves Christ in the Spirit. The Spirit gives a holy solemnity to every thought of Jesus, so that it is psychologically impossible to think of the true Christ with humor or levity. Neither can there be any unbecoming familiarity. The Person of Christ precludes all such. Then, self-abasement is always found in the heart that loves Jesus with true spiritual love. When Paul saw Jesus, he fell on his face. John fell down as dead, and every soul that ever saw and felt the terror and wonder of His glorious Presence, has known some such experience of self-abasement. It is important that we know whether our relation to Jesus is divine or human. It will pay us to find out now.','John 15:9&ndash;10','As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father&rsquo;s commands and remain in his love.','Christ has loved us as the Father loved Him. We are to live in Christ&rsquo;s love, which is shown by obeying Him, not merely to escape the results of disobedience but because we love Him.','O Lord, forgive me for those sentimental outbursts of which I am sometimes guilty that are supposed to express love. If I really love You, I will obey You and worship You.'),(148,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Ten','Our Christian Obligation to Care','26','Living as Light in the World','Whether or not the Christian should separate himself from the world is not open to debate; the question was settled by the sacred Scriptures, an authority from which there can be no appeal. The New Testament is very plain: &ldquo;They are not of the world,&rdquo; said our Lord, &ldquo;even as I am not of the world.&rdquo; James wrote, &ldquo;Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God&rdquo; Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.&rdquo; John said, &ldquo;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.&rdquo; Such teaching as this would appear to be plain enough, and there should be no doubt about what is intended. But we must never underestimate the ability of the human mind to get lost on a paved highway in broad daylight. Some well-intentioned souls have managed to get themselves confused about their relation to the world and have sought to escape it by hiding from it. They read into the biblical command to separate from the world the idea of complete withdrawal from all human activities and seek peace of heart by cutting themselves off, as far as possible, from the great stream of human life and thought. And that is not good.','Matthew 5:14&ndash;16','You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.','If God had wanted us completely out of the world He could have taken us home to heaven at the time of our spiritual birth. No, we are to be in the world but not of it. We are to shine as light in the world system&rsquo;s darkness.','Forgive me, Lord, for unhealthy accommodation to the world in which I live. May I not forget that I am a stranger here with citizenship in heaven&mdash;but a stranger ablaze with the light of Christ.'),(149,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Ten','Our Christian Obligation to Care','27','Living as Relatives to Humankind','We human beings were made for each other, and what any of us is doing at any time cannot be a matter of indifference to the rest of us. On the human plane, all men are brothers. The Son of Man never denied this sweet tie with humankind. Over a stubborn and sinful Jerusalem, He shed tears, and in the hour of death, He prayed for men who were so blind as to nail their God on a tree. And Paul, who burned always to be like his Lord, wept over the unbelieving Israel with an anguish that goaded him to an utterance so daring as to cause the ages to wonder: &ldquo;I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.&rdquo; Peace of heart that is won by refusing to bear the common yoke of human sympathy is a peace unworthy of a Christian. To seek tranquility by stopping our ears to the cries of human pain is to make ourselves not Christians but a kind of degenerate stoic, having no relation either to stoicism or Christianity. We Christians should never try to escape from the burdens and woes of life among men. The hermit and the anchorite sound good in poetry, but stripped of their artificial romance, they are not good examples of what the followers of Christ should be. True peace comes not by a retreat from the world but by the overpowering presence of Christ in the heart. &ldquo;Christ in you&rdquo; is the answer to our cry for peace. The Salvation Army lassie distributing gospel literature in a saloon is a better example of the separated life than a prim and cold-faced saint who has long ago fled the world to take refuge in the barren caverns of her soul.','2 Peter 3:9','The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.','The Lord does not want anyone to perish. Do I? Do I care enough to pray and to reach out in His name?','Father, will You enable me to see people as You see them?'),(150,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Ten','Our Christian Obligation to Care','28','Living as Good Samaritans','The testimony of the true follower of Christ might well be something like this: The world&rsquo;s pleasures and the world&rsquo;s treasures henceforth have no appeal for me. I reckon myself crucified to the world and the world crucified to me. But the multitudes that were so dear to Christ shall not be less dear to me. If I cannot prevent their moral suicide, I shall at least baptize them with my human tears. I want no blessing that I cannot share. I seek no spirituality that I must win at the cost of forgetting that men and women are lost and without hope. If in spite of all I can do they will sin against light and bring upon themselves the displeasure of a holy God, then I must not let them go their sad way unwept. I scorn a happiness that I must purchase with ignorance. I reject a heaven that I must enter by shutting my eyes to the sufferings of my fellow men. I choose a broken heart rather than any happiness that ignores the tragedy of human life and human death. Though I, through the grace of God in Christ, no longer lie under Adam&rsquo;s sin, I would still feel a bond of compassion for all of Adam&rsquo;s tragic race, and I am determined that I shall go down to the grave or up into God&rsquo;s heaven mourning for the lost and the perishing. And thus and thus will I do as God enables me. Amen','Luke 10:36&ndash;37','&ldquo;Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?&rdquo; The expert in the law replied, &ldquo;The one who had mercy on him.&rdquo; Jesus told him, &ldquo;Go and do likewise.&rdquo;','Good Samaritan living does not come naturally. We are afraid of rejection, of being robbed ourselves, of being taken advantage of. But intercession for those around will eventually result in reaching out to them in Christ&rsquo;s name.','O Lord, help me to see people around me as You see them&mdash;to pray for them, reach out to them, and be a &ldquo;Good Samaritan&rdquo; to them. I can&rsquo;t do it myself; I&rsquo;ve tried. Change me, for Christ&rsquo;s sake.'),(151,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Twelve','\"I\'m a Stranger Here Myself\"','29','Wrestling with those Unanswerable Questions','All of us at some time in our lives become suddenly aware that we are in a strange place called the world. We do not remember coming here, and we are not sure when or how we are going to leave. A score of pressing questions fill our minds. We must have the answers. Where did we come from? What are we? Why are we here? Where do we go next? What does God require of us? How can we find the heaven of peace? Such questions as these insist upon an answer. But we have no answer. Then we approach someone who looks as if he might know. We eagerly put our question, but we get only a shake of the head and the usual, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m a stranger here myself.&rdquo; At first, we are frightfully disappointed, for we had hoped someone might know. There are the great stone buildings covered with ivy, where the best brains of the world hold forth day after day. There are the great libraries piled with solemn books, each filled with learned words. But the desired answer is nowhere. A few attempt to direct us but prove by their own bewilderment that they know as little as we do about the whole thing. The philosopher seeks but never finds. The scientist searches but finds no data to help us beyond the last hour and the narrow house and the shroud. The poet soars on stubby wings but soon comes down again, tired and confused. Each one has the same answer: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m a stranger here myself.&rdquo;','Psalm 147:5','Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.','God&rsquo;s understanding has no limit, but ours does. He is God. We are created humans. There is so much we do not understand, have not experienced, and cannot comprehend. Some of our questions will never be answered in this life. Others will not need to be. But we can trust God&rsquo;s sovereign plan.','Father, those burning questions for which I have found no answer I bring to You. Into Your arms I place them and I place myself. You are my Abba.'),(152,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Twelve','\"I\'m a Stranger Here Myself\"','30','God\'s Word Gives Light','&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; I&rsquo;m a stranger here myself.&rdquo; That is the only honest answer. Others are sometimes given, but they are never valid answers. They spring out of pride or error or uncritical and wishful thinking, and they are not to be trusted. It is no good asking for information of another who is as ignorant as ourselves. We are all strangers in a strange world. Is our state hopeless then? Is no answer to be had? Must we live in a world we do not understand and go out into a future of dark uncertainty? No, thank God; things are not as bad as that. There is an answer. We can find light. Our questions have been answered. &ldquo;From a child,&rdquo; wrote Paul to Timothy, &ldquo;thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&rdquo; It is the universal testimony of the saints of the ages that when the light of the Scriptures enters, the darkness of spiritual ignorance vanishes. God&rsquo;s Word giveth light. It has answer for every question that matters. The merely curious question it ignores, but every real inquiry made by the sincere heart is met with full light. It is important that we search the Scriptures daily and more important still that we approach them with faith and humility, bowing our hearts to their instructions and commands. Then through faith in Christ, we cease to be strangers and become sons of God.','Psalm 119:130','The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.','God&rsquo;s words give light on those most difficult of life issues. That light does not necessarily illuminate quickly nor to our full satisfaction. Imperative is careful searching of God&rsquo;s Word and serious listening to His voice. But God does give light!','Father, You are God. You know all things. You are from forever to forever. To You I come with those burning questions. Your answers to some I cannot yet understand. My mind is restricted and my experience limited. Yet in You I find light and peace.'),(153,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Thirteen','We Must Think Like Christians','31','Distinguishing What is Caesar\'s and What is God\'s','One thing must be kept in mind: We Christians are Christians first and everything else after that. Our first allegiance is to the kingdom of God. Our citizenship is in heaven. We are grateful for political freedom. We thank God for democracy as a way of life. But we never forget that we are sons of God and citizens of another city whose builder and maker is God. For this reason, we must not identify the gospel with any political system or make Christianity to be synonymous with any form of government, however noble. Christ stands alone, above and outside of every ideology devised by man. He does not join any of our parties or take sides with any of our great men except as they may come over on His side and try to follow Him in righteousness and true holiness. Then He is for them but only as individuals, never as leaders of some political faction. The true Christian will be loyal to his country and obedient to those in authority, but he will never fall into the error of confusing his own national culture with Christianity. Christianity is bigger than any country, loftier than any civilization, broader than any human ideology.','Matthew 22:21b','Then he said to them, &ldquo;Give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God what is God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;','We have dual citizenship&mdash;God&rsquo;s Kingdom and a nation of the world. To that country&rsquo;s government we have responsibility&mdash;laws to follow, taxes to pay, duties inherent in citizenship. Being good citizens will mean working to change what needs to be changed while remaining true to our King Jesus.','Your Kingdom, Lord, includes followers of Christ from differing ethnic groups, social classes, and political persuasions. Oh God, help me to accept the diversity while rejoicing in family, for Jesus&rsquo; sake.'),(154,'The Next Chapter after the Last','Thirteen','We Must Think Like Christians',NULL,'Everyone\'s Savior','It may shock some people to be told that Christ is not an American. Nor was He a Jew merely. He was born of the seed of Abraham of the line of David, and His mother was a Jewess of the tribe of Judah. Still, Christ is vastly more than a Jew. His dearest name for Himself was &ldquo;the Son of Man.&rdquo; He came through the Jewish race, but He came to the human race. He is everyman&rsquo;s countryman and everyman&rsquo;s contemporary. He is building a kingdom of all nations and tribes and tongues and peoples. He has no favorites, &ldquo;but in every nation he that fearest him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.&rdquo; Let us remember that the gospel is a divine thing. It receives no virtue from any of man&rsquo;s religions or philosophies. It came down to us out of heaven, a separate thing, like Peter&rsquo;s sheet, wholly on its own. It is something given of God. It operates in the individual heart, wherever that heart may be found. Any form of human government, however lofty, deals with the citizen only as long as he lives. At the graveside it bids him adieu. It may have made his journey a little easier, and, if so, all lovers of the human race will thank God for that. But in the cool earth, slaves and free men lie down together. Then what matter the talk and the turmoil? Who was right and who was wrong in this or that political squabble doesn&rsquo;t matter to the dead. Judgment and sin and heaven and hell are all that matter then. So, let&rsquo;s keep cool, and let&rsquo;s think like Christians. Christ will be standing upright, tall and immortal, after the tumult and the shouting dies and the captains and the kings lie stretched side by side, the &ldquo;cause&rdquo; that made them famous forgotten and their whole significance reduced to a paragraph in a history book.','John 1:14a','The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.','Christ did not come to a particular people in a particular area of the world. He assumed a certain ethnicity. He took on full humanity. But He came to be the Savior and Lord of every man and woman. He belongs to all peoples who will open their hearts to Him.','O Christ, You are praised and worshiped today in hundreds of languages and cultural forms. You are no more my Lord than the Lord of other believers around the world.

Who are we to imagine that we are &ldquo;bailing out&rdquo; the living God when we drop a $10 bill in the Sunday offering plate? Let us thank God for the reality of His causeless existence. Our God only is all-sufficient, uncreated, unborn, the living and eternal and self-existent God! I refer often to the great worshiping heart of Frederick William Faber, who in these words celebrated his vision of God&rsquo;s eternal self-existence: Father! The sweetest, dearest Name that men or angels know! Fountain of life, that had no fount from which itself could flow. Thy vastness is not young or old, Thy life hath never grown; no time can measure out Thy days, no space can make Thy throne!','Genesis 1:10','In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.','Our God only is all-sufficient, uncreated, unborn, the living and eternal and self-existent God!','Lord, I do not come close to being able to understand what You are, except that You loved me enough to make me Your son, so I call You Father.

As God&rsquo;s faithful children, we should be attracted to holiness, for holiness Godlikeness&mdash;likeness to God! God encourages every Christian believer to follow after holiness. We know who we are, and we know who God is. He does not ask us to be God, and He does not ask us to produce the holiness that only He Himself knows. Only God is holy absolutely: all other beings can be holy only in relative degrees. Actually, it is amazing and wonderful that God should promise us the privilege of sharing in His nature. He remembers we were made of dust. So He tells us what is in His being as He thinks of us: &ldquo;It is My desire that you grow in grace and in the knowledge of Me. I want you to be more like Jesus, My eternal Son, every day you live!&rdquo;','2 Peter 1:4','Precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature.','God encourages every Christian believer to follow after holiness.

When will they realize that if they could possibly &ldquo;discover&rdquo; God, they realize that with the intellect, they would be equal to God? Isaiah is a dramatic example of God&rsquo;s revelation of Himself to mankind. Isaiah could have tried for a million years to reach God by means of his intellect. But brainpower is not the means by which we find God! Brethren, it is true that all of us would still be far from God if He had not graciously and in love revealed Himself to us. In the space of a short second of time, the Lord who loves us can reveal Himself to the willing spirit of a man or woman. It is only then that an Isaiah, or any one of us, can say with humble assurance, &ldquo;I know Him!&rdquo; A committed Christian, then, should have upon him an element that is beyond psychology&mdash;beyond all natural laws and into spiritual laws!','Isaiah 6:1, 5','I saw also the Lord . . . then said I, woe is me! for I am undone.','Brainpower is not the means by which we find God!','Lord, I pray that You will continue to help me find You in Your own way, because I know that the wisdom of man is foolishness to You.'),(158,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Jesus Said He Was God','The more we study the words of our Lord Jesus Christ when He lived on earth among us, the more certain we are about who He is. Some critics have scoffed, &ldquo;Jesus did not claim to be God. He only said He was the Son of Man.&rdquo; It is true that Jesus used the term &ldquo;Son of Man&rdquo; frequently. But He testified boldly, even among those who were His sworn enemies, that He was God. He said with great forcefulness that He had come from the Father in heaven and that He was equal with the Father. Bible-believing Christians stand together on this. They may differ about the mode of baptism, church policy, or the return of the Lord, but they agree on the deity of the eternal Son. Jesus Christ is of one substance with the Father&mdash;begotten, not created (Nicene Creed). In our defense of this truth, we must be very careful and old-belligerent, if need be! Christ is the brightness of God&rsquo;s glory and the express image of God&rsquo;s Person!','Hebrews 1:8','But unto the Son he saith, &ldquo;Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.&rdquo;','Christ is the brightness of God&rsquo;s glory and the express image of God&rsquo;s Person!','Lord, I do realize that You are just who You said You are, and I worship You as the Son of God.'),(159,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Both Lord And Christ','No Christian believer should ever forget what the Bible says about the Person and the offices of the eternal Son, the Christ of God. &ldquo;God hath made this same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). Jesus means Savior; Lord means Sovereign; Christ means Anointed One. The apostle Peter did not proclaim Jesus only as Savior; he preached to them Jesus as Lord and Christ and Savior, never dividing His Person or His offices. Remember, also, the declaration of Paul: &ldquo;If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, thou shalt be saved.&rdquo; Three times in the passage to the Roman Christians telling how to be saved, Paul calls Jesus &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo; He says that faith in the Lord Jesus plus confession of that faith to the world brings salvation to us!','Acts 2:36','God hath made this same Jesus . . . both Lord and Christ.','Jesus means Savior; Lord means Sovereign; Christ means Anointed One.','Lord, thank You for who You are. Please strengthen me as I live to serve You and accomplish Your will.'),(160,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Truth Is a Person','Let me say boldly that it is not the difficulty of discovering truth but the unwillingness to obey it that makes it so rare among men. Our Lord said, &ldquo;I am the Truth.&rdquo; And again He said, &ldquo;The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.&rdquo; Truth, therefore, is not hard to find for the very reason that it is seeking us! So we learn that Truth is not a thing for which we must search, but a Person to whom we must hearken! In the New Testament, multitudes came to Jesus for physical help, but only rarely did one seek Him out to learn the Truth. The whole picture in the gospels is one of a seeking Savior, not one of seeking men. The Truth was hunting for those who would receive it, and relatively few did, for &ldquo;many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo;','John 8:31&ndash;32','Then said Jesus . . . And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.','So we learn that Truth is not a thing for which we must search but a Person to whom we must hearken!','Lord, You have said that You are the Truth.  Now please make me listen. I am ready.'),(161,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Christ Is Not Divided','Much of our full gospel literature and much of our preaching tend to perpetuate a misunderstanding of what the Bible says about obedience and Christian discipleship. I think the following is a fair statement of what I was taught in my early Christian experience and before I began to pray and study and anguish over the whole matter: &ldquo;We are saved by accepting Christ as our Savior. We are sanctified by accepting Christ as our Lord. We may do the first without doing the second.&rdquo; What a tragedy that in our day we often hear the gospel appeal made in this way: &ldquo;Come to Jesus! You do not have to obey anyone. You do not have to give up anything. Just come to Him and believe in Him as Savior!&rdquo; The fact that we hear this everywhere does not make it right! To urge men and women to believe in a divided Christ is bad teaching&mdash;for no one can receive a half or a third or a quarter of the divine Person of Christ!','John 14:23','Jesus answered, If a man love me, he will keep my words.','To urge men and women to believe in a divided Christ is bad teaching&mdash;for no one can receive a half or a third or a quarter of the divine Person of Christ!','Dear Lord, I pray You remind me always that believing is obeying, and I pray that You will create a spirit of evangelism in our churches that teaches the true meaning of conversion.'),(162,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Who Hears The Call Of God?','Who can deny that there are certain persons who, though still unconverted, nevertheless differ from the crowd, marked out of God, stricken with an interior wound and susceptible to the call of God? In the prayer of Jesus in John 17:1lb, He said: &ldquo;Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me.&rdquo; Surely no man is ever the same after God has laid His hand upon him. He will have certain marks, perhaps some not easy to detect. First might be a deep reverence for divine things. A sense of the sacred must be present or there can be no receptivity to God and truth. Another mark is great moral sensitivity. When God begins to work in a man to bring him to salvation He makes him acutely sensitive to evil. Another mark of the Spirit&rsquo;s working is a mighty moral discontent. It does take a work of God in a man to sour him on the world and to turn him against himself; yet until this has happened he is psychologically unable to repent and believe!','John 6:68','Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.','Surely no man is ever the same after God has laid His hand upon him.

The words &ldquo;whosoever will may come&rdquo; throw the door open, indeed, but the church is carrying the gospel invitation far beyond its proper bounds, turning it into something more human and less divine than that found in the sacred Scriptures. What we tend to overlook is that the word &ldquo;whosoever&rdquo; never stands by itself. Always, its meaning is modified by the word &ldquo;believe&rdquo; or &ldquo;will&rdquo; or &ldquo;come.&rdquo; According to the teachings of Christ, no one will or can come and believe unless there has been done within him a prevenient work of God, enabling him to do so. In the sixth chapter of John, Jesus teaches as that no one can come of himself; he must first be drawn by the Father. &ldquo;It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing,&rdquo; Jesus said. Before any man or woman can be saved, he or she must feel a consuming spiritual hunger. Where a hungry heart is found, we may be sure that God was there first. &ldquo;Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you&rdquo; (John 15:16).','Revelation 22:17','Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.','According to the teachings of Christ, no one will or can come and believe unless there has been done within him a prevenient work of God enabling him to do so.','Lord, thank You for preparing me to come to You, and thank you for such a wondrous salvation.

Yet even in the full light it provides, people are indifferent. Upon our eyes there seems to have fallen a strange dimness within our ears, a strange dullness. It is a wonder, and a terrible responsibility that we should have this message in our possession and be so little stirred about it! I confess that it is very hard for me to accept the fact that it is now very rare for anyone to come into the house of God silently confessing, &ldquo;Dear Lord, I am ready and willing to hear what you will speak to me today!&rdquo;','John 3:17','For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world.','It is a wonder, and a terrible responsibility, that we should have this message in our possession and be so little stirred about it!','Lord, stir me up, and make me willing to hear what You have to say today.'),(165,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','We Are Not Orphans','I once wrote in an editorial that Christian believers are not orphans in this world, making the point that the divine Shepherd goes before us and that we travel an appointed way.

That is what the Presbyterians believe. Just what did you mean?&rdquo; I replied that I had not meant to go down that deep into doctrine&mdash;that I had not been thinking of foreordination, predestination, or the eternal decrees. &ldquo;I was just satisfied that if a consecrated Christian will put himself in the hands of God, even the accidents may be turned into blessings,&rdquo; I told him. Anyway, I am sure the Methodist brother can go to sleep at night knowing that he does not have to become a Presbyterian to be certain that God is looking after him!','Psalm 37:23','The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.','I am sure the Methodist brother can go to sleep at night knowing that he does not have to become a Presbyterian to be certain that God is looking after him!','Lord, indeed You know what will be from day to day, and You know me best.

Your heart becomes a chamber, a sanctuary, a shrine in which there may be continuous, unbroken fellowship and communion with God. Your worship rises to God moment by moment! We have all found that God will not dwell in spiteful and proud and selfish thoughts. He treasures our pure and loving thoughts, our meek and charitable and kindly thoughts. They are the thoughts like His own! As God dwells in your thoughts, you will be worshiping, and God will be accepting. He will be smelling the incense of your high intentions even when the cares of life are intense and there is activity all around you. This leaves us no argument. We know what God wants us to be. He wants us to be worshipers!','Psalm 139:23','Search me, O God . . . and try me, and know my thoughts.','As God dwells in your thoughts, you will be worshiping, and God will be accepting.

They do not find it a tyranny; they find it a delight! Here is something that we should know and realize: heaven is a place of surrender to the whole will of God, and it is heaven because it is such a place. I thank God that heaven is the world of God&rsquo;s obedient children. Whatever else we may say of its pearly gates, golden streets, and jasper walls, heaven is heaven because children of the Most High God find they are in their normal sphere as obedient moral beings.','John 13:17','If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.','The happiness of all moral creatures lies in the giving of obedience to God, the Creator.','Lord, I do look forward to heaven, and I wish to replicate a little of what heaven will be like here and now.

It is a fact that many of our church folks are activists engaged in many religious journeys, but they do not seem to move up any closer to Jesus in heart and in spirit. This modern religious emphasis on activity reminds me of the Japanese mice I have seen in the pet store windows. They are called waltzing mice, but they do not waltz. They just run continually! Many in our churches hope to have a part in &ldquo;something big and exciting.&rdquo; But God calls us back&mdash;back to the simplicity of the faith, back to the simplicity of Jesus Christ and His unchanging Person!','Mark 6:31','And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart . . . and rest awhile.','It is a fact that many of our church folks are activists engaged in many religious journeys, but they do not seem to move up any closer to Jesus in heart and in spirit.','Dear Lord, I pray that what is important in life will not be lost in a flurry of activity.

The difficulty we modern Christians face is not misunderstanding the Bible but persuading our untamed hearts to accept its plain instruction. Our problem is to get the consent of our world-loving minds to make Jesus Lord in fact as well as in word&mdash;for it is one thing to say, &ldquo;Lord, Lord,&rdquo; and quite another thing to obey the Lord&rsquo;s commandments. We may sing &ldquo;Crown Him Lord of all&rdquo; and rejoice in the tones of the loud organ and the deep melody in harmonious voices, but still we have done nothing until we have left the world and set our faces toward the City of God in hard practical reality. The world&rsquo;s spirit is strong and it can play at religion with every appearance of sincerity. It can have fits of conscience (particularly during Lent). It will contribute to charitable causes and campaigns on behalf of the poor but all with its own condition: &ldquo;Let Christ keep His distance and never assert His Lordship.&rdquo; This it positively will not endure!','1 John5:4','Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.','The difficulty we modern Christians face is not misunderstanding the Bible but persuading our untamed hearts to accept its plain instruction.','Lord, take my life as a complete and sincere offering to You and keep my mind set on obedience while my feet stay ready to do Your will.'),(170,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','We See God\'s Purpose','We trust the Word of God, and the inspired revelation makes it plain to the believing Christian that all things in the universe have derived their form from Christ, the eternal Son!

Everything in the universe has received its meaning by the power of His word; each has maintained its place and order through Him. Jesus Christ is God creating! Jesus Christ is God redeeming! Jesus Christ is God completing and harmonizing! Jesus Christ is God bringing together all things after the counsel of His own will!

Of nothing else in the Creation is it said that it was created in the likeness of God! Because fallen and perishing man is still nearer to God&rsquo;s likeness than any other creature on earth, God offers him conversion, regeneration, and forgiveness. It was surely because of this great potential in the human personality that the eternal Word could become flesh and dwell among us. We are assured in many ways in the Scriptures that God the Creator does not waste human personality, but it is surely one of the stark tragedies of life that human personality can waste itself! A man by his own sin may waste himself, which is to waste and lose that which on earth is most like God. The man who dies out of Christ is said to be lost, and hardly a word in our language expresses his condition with greater accuracy!','Matthew 25:41','Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.','We are assured in many ways in the Scriptures that God the Creator does not waste human personality, but it is surely one of the stark tragedies of life that human personality can waste itself!','Lord, I pray that You will use me to turn around lives that are being wasted.'),(172,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','We Were Outcasts, Too','We confess, do we not, that we have a Christian responsibility to believe God&rsquo;s Word and to obey God&rsquo;s Truth?

The great spiritual needs around us should drive us back to the gospel records of the life and ministry of our Lord Jesus. When evil men crucified Jesus, killed Him, they had no power to change Him. They could not alter the Person or the personality of the Son of God. Putting Him on the cross did not drain away any of His divine affection for a lost race. The best thing we know about our Lord and Savior is that He loves the sinner. He has always loved the outcast and for that we should be glad, for we, too, were once outcasts! We are descended from that first man and woman who failed God and disobeyed.

God has never yet turned away an honest, sincere person who has come to know the eternal value of the atonement and the peace that is promised through the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. The only person who will never be cleansed and made whole is the one who insists he or she needs no remedy. The person who comes in faith to God and confesses, &ldquo;I am unclean; I am sin-sick; I am blind,&rdquo; will find mercy and righteousness and life.

Even in nature around us, there appears to be very little individual concern. The burden of concern is always for the species. But Jesus did not preach to the multitudes as though they were a faceless crowd. He preached to them as individuals and with a knowledge of the burdens and the needs of each one.

Divine revelation is the ground upon which we stand. The Bible is the book of God, and I stand for it with all my heart; but before I can be saved, there must be illumination, penitence, renewal, and inward deliverance. In our Christendom, we have tried to ease many people into the Kingdom but they have never been renewed within their own beings. The apostle Paul told the Corinthians that their faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God! There is a difference.

He must count no time wasted, which is spent in the cultivation of His acquaintance. He must give himself to meditation and prayer hours on end. So did the saints of old, the glorious company of the apostles, the goodly fellowship of the prophets and the believing members of the holy Church in all generations.

On the other hand, the newest Christian believer has already learned many marvelous things at the center of truth. He has met and knows God! That is the primary issue, my brother and sister. That is why we earnestly invite men and women to become converted, taking Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord!','1 Thessalonians 2:4','Not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.','All things fit into shape and form when you begin with God!','Lord, I will make You the center of truth in my life today and always.

Not all of Nero&rsquo;s swords could ever cut down through the substance of the Godhead to cut off the Father from the Son. It was Mary&rsquo;s Son who cried out, &ldquo;Why hast Thou forsaken me?&rdquo; It was the human body, which God had given Him. It was the sacrifice that cried&mdash;the Lamb about to die! The Son of Man knew himself forsaken. God dumped that vast, filthy, slimy mass of human sin on the soul of the Savior and then backed away. Believe it that the ancient and timeless Deity was never separated. He was still in the bosom of the Father when He cried, &ldquo;Into Thy hands I commend my spirit!&rdquo; Little wonder that we are amazed and marvel every day at the wonder of the ancient theology of the Christian church!','Luke 23:46','Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.','Not all of Nero&rsquo;s swords could ever cut down through the substance of the Godhead to cut off the Father from the Son.','Lord, I am amazed at the gulf that You spanned for us.

Holy!&rdquo; I am a trinitarian&mdash;I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Father, begotten of Him before all ages. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of life, who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified. Isaiah was an astonished man. He could only manage this witness: &ldquo;Mine eyes have seen the King!&rdquo; Only the King of glory can reveal Himself to the willing spirit of a man, so that an Isaiah or any other man or woman can say with humility but with assurance, &ldquo;I know Him!&rdquo;','1 John 5:8','And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.','I have often wondered why the rabbis and saints and hymnists of the olden times did not come to the knowledge of the Trinity just from the seraphims&rsquo; chorus: &ldquo;Holy!

But I am forced to ask how can we insist and teach that our Lord Jesus Christ can be our Savior without being our Lord? How can so many continue to teach that we can be saved without any thought of obedience to our Sovereign Lord? I am satisfied in my own heart that when a man or a woman believes on the Lord Jesus Christ he or she must believe on the whole Lord Jesus Chris, not making any reservation! How can a teaching be justified when it encourages sinners to use Jesus as a Savior in their time of need, without owing Him obedience and allegiance? I believe we need to return to preaching a whole Christ to our needy world!','1 Corinthians 1:9','God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.','How can we insist and teach that our Lord Jesus Christ can be our Savior without being our Lord?','Lord, help me not to lead people into a false belief.

Righteousness is not a word easily acceptable to lost men and women in a lost world. Outside of the Word of God, there is no book or treatise that can give us a satisfying answer about righteousness, because the only One who is Lord of all righteousness is our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself. A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of His Kingdom. He is the only One in all the universe who perfectly loved righteousness and hated iniquity. Our great High Priest and Mediator is the righteous and holy One&mdash;Jesus Christ, our risen Lord. He is not only righteous, He is the Lord of all righteousness! Then there is His wisdom. The sum total of the deep and eternal wisdom of the ages lies in Jesus Christ as a treasure hidden away. All the deep purposes of God reside in Him because His perfect wisdom enables Him to plan far ahead! Thus history itself becomes the slow development of His purposes.','1 Corinthians 1:30','But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness.','Christ is the only One in all of the universe who perfectly loved righteousness and hated iniquity.','Lord, thank You for the reminder that You are the author of righteousness and wisdom.

The message of the Cross is good news indeed for the penitent, and also to those who obey not the gospel, it carries an overtone of warning. The Spirit&rsquo;s ministry to the impenitent world is to tell of sin and righteousness and judgment. For sinners who want to cease being willful sinners and become obedient children of God, the gospel message is one of unqualified peace, but it is by its very nature also an arbiter of the future destinies of man. Actually, the message of the gospel may be received in either of two ways: in word only without power or in word with power. The truth received in power shifts the bases of life from Adam to Christ&mdash;a new and different Spirit enters the personality and makes the believing man new in every department of his being!','Acts 24:25','As he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled.','The message of the Cross is good news indeed for the penitent, and also to those who obey not the gospel, it carries an overtone of warning.','Lord, I am reminded that to truly be Your son I had to surrender all to You.

That is why we come in faith and rejoicing to the eternal verity of Hebrews 13:8: &ldquo;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever!&rdquo; This proclamation gives significance to every other section of teaching and exhortation in the letter to the Hebrews. In this verse is truth that is morally and spiritually dynamic if we will exercise the faith and the will to demonstrate it in our needy world. I think this fact, this truth that Jesus Christ wants to be known in His church as the ever-living, never-changing Lord of all, could bring back again the power and testimony of the Early Church!','Hebrews 13:8','Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.','I think this fact, this truth that Jesus Christ wants to be known in His church as the ever-living, never-changing Lord of all, could bring back again the power and testimony of the early church!','Lord, I am so thankful that You are always the same.

It is a fact that positive beliefs are not popular these days. I sense that the modern efforts to popularize the Christian faith have been extremely damaging to that faith. The purpose has been to simplify truth for the masses by using the language of the masses instead of the language of the Church. It has not succeeded, but has added to rather than diminished religious confusion. A mistaken desire to maintain a spirit of tolerance among all races and religions has produced a breed of Janus-like Christians with built-in swivels, remarkable only for their ability to turn in any direction gracefully! Our Christian beliefs have been revealed by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in the sacred Scriptures. Everything there is clear-cut and accurate.

I hope, too, that you may begin to understand why many evangelical churches are in such a mess. It has become popular to preach a painless Christianity and automatic saintliness. It has become a part of our &ldquo;instant&rdquo; culture&mdash;&ldquo;just pour a little water on it, stir mildly, pick up a gospel tract, and you are on your Christian way!&rdquo; &ldquo;Lo,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;this is Bible Christianity!&rdquo; It is nothing of the sort! To depend upon that kind of a formula is to experience only the outer fringe, the edge of what Christianity really is.

With that as a definition, those who know they are Christians &ldquo;in name only&rdquo; should never make the pretense of being normal Christians. Thankfully those who are &ldquo;normal&rdquo; are constantly being drawn to praise and worship, charmed by the moral beauty, which is found only in Jesus. I cannot understand how anyone can profess to be a follower and a disciple of our Lord Jesus Christ and not be overwhelmed by His attributes. Those divine attributes faithfully attest that He is indeed Lord of all, completely worthy of our worship and praise!','Luke 12:34','Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.','I cannot understand how anyone can profess to be a follower and a disciple of our Lord Jesus Christ and not be overwhelmed by His attributes.','Lord, I pray that I never am considered just a nominal Christian.

You have been to Bible conferences; you have been to the altar, but the blessings are for someone else. That attitude on the part of Christian believers is neither modesty nor meekness; it is a chronic discouragement, resulting from unbelief. It is rather like those who have been sick for so long that they no longer believe they can get well. Jesus is still saying, as He said to the man lying by the gate at the Jerusalem pool, &ldquo;Do you want to be made whole?&rdquo; Jesus made him whole because of his desire! His need was great, but he had never lapsed into that state of chronic discouragement.','John 5:6','When Jesus saw . . . he saith unto him, &ldquo;Wilt thou be made whole?&rdquo;','Jesus is still saying, as He said to the man lying by the gate at the Jerusalem pool, &ldquo;Do you want to be made whole?&rdquo;','Lord, My desire is to be whole.

The scientists may be able to keep us alive for a few extra years, but believing Christians know some things that Einstein did not know! For instance, we know why we are here. We can say why we were born. We also know what we believe about the value of things eternal. We are thankful that we have found the promise from the God of all grace that deals with the long-term and the eternal. We belong to a company of the plain people who believe the truth revealed in the Bible. Actually, the wisest person in the world is the person who knows the most about God; the person who realizes that the answer to creation and life and eternity is a theological answer, not a scientific answer!','2 Corinthians 4:18','Things which are seen are temporal; but things which are not seen are eternal.','We are thankful that we have found the promise from the God of all grace that deals with the long-term and the eternal.','Lord, make me truly wise by teaching me all I can know about You.'),(195,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Image We Project','Are we presently missing important elements of worship in our churches?

But as evangelical Christian believers, are we as concerned as we should be about the image we really project to the community around us? It cannot be denied that many who profess the name of Christ still fail to show forth His love and compassion! It should say something to us that the often-quoted Jean-Paul Sartre described his turning to philosophy and hopelessness as a turning away from a secularistic church. His indictment: &ldquo;I did not recognize in the fashionable God who was taught me, Him who was waiting for my soul. I needed a Creator; I was given a big businessman!&rdquo;','Psalm 95:6&ndash;7','O come, let us worship and bow down; for he is our God.','It cannot be denied that many who profess the name of Christ still fail to show forth His love and compassion!','Lord, let my life be a bright reflection of the love You give to me.'),(196,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Worship And Work','I must take issue with those in the churches who insist that the worshiping saints do not get anything done but worship!

Listen to me! Practically every great deed done in the Church of Christ all the way back to the apostles was done by people blazing with the radiant worship of their God! The great hospitals and the mental institutions have grown out of the hearts of worshiping and compassionate disciples. It is true also that wherever the Church has come out of her lethargy and into the tides of revival and spiritual renewal, always the worshipers were back of it. A survey of Church history will prove that it was those who were the yearning worshipers who also became the great workers and the selfless servants. If we give ourselves to God&rsquo;s call for worship, everyone will do more for the Savior than they are doing now!','1 Thessalonians 4:12','And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men.','The beautiful part of worship is that it prepares you and enables you to zero in on the important things that must be done for God.','Lord, may worship draw me toward Your work I know I am to do for You, and may it prepare me to do it well.'),(197,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Tears Of Joy-Amen!','We need not be afraid of a genuine visitation of the Spirit of God!

In Pascal&rsquo;s own hand it read: From about half past ten at night to about half after midnight&mdash;fire! O God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob&mdash;not the God of philosophers or the wise. The God of Jesus Christ who can be known only in the ways of the gospel. Security. Feeling. Peace. Joy.

The same Bible sermon that brings the person to tearful submission at an altar of prayer will send others out with pride and a resolve to have their own human way. Students of the Scriptures are aware that the Old Testament prophets and the writing apostles of New Testament times foresaw and proclaimed God&rsquo;s coming day of judgment&mdash;the consummate settling of accounts between the Sovereign God and his rebellious and sinful creation. How desperately we would like to believe that in the face of coming judgment, all lost men and women will cry out to God, but such will not be the case: &ldquo;The rest of mankind that were not killed by these plagues still did not repent&rdquo; (Revelation 9:20).','Revelation 9:20','The rest of mankind . . . still did not repent.','The same act that may cause one person to repent and believe will cause others to hate and despise God!','Lord, make my heart soft, and help me to listen and to do Your good will.'),(199,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','Response To The Word','Men and women who read and study the Scriptures for their literary beauty alone have missed the whole purpose for which they were given.

Until it has secured these, it has done nothing positive for the reader, but it has increased his responsibility and deepened the judgment that must follow. The Bible was called forth by the fall of man. It is the voice of God calling men home from the wilds of sin; it is a road map for returning prodigals. It is instruction in righteousness, light in darkness, information about God and man and life and death and heaven and hell. Further, the destiny of each individual depends upon the response to that Voice in the Word!','Hebrews 4:12','The word of God . . . is sharper than any two-edged sword.','The Bible demands immediate action, faith, surrender, and committal.','Lord, may my response to Your Word be one that will make its words like sweet music to my ears.

It is not surprising that many of His early followers, upon hearing these words, went back and walked no more with Him. Such teaching cannot but be deeply disturbing to the natural mind. It takes from sinful men much of the power of self-determination. It cuts the ground out from under their self-help and throws them back upon the sovereign good pleasure of God&mdash;and that is precisely where they do not want to be! These statements by our Lord run contrary to the current assumptions of popular Christianity. Men are willing to be saved by grace, but to preserve their self-esteem, they must hold that the desire to be saved originated with them. Most Christians today seem afraid to talk about these plain words of Jesus concerning the sovereign operation of God, so they use the simple trick of ignoring them!','John 6:66','From that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.','Men are willing to be saved by grace, but to preserve their self-esteem, they must hold that the desire to be saved originated with them.','Lord, I understand that I could never have come to You on my own.

So the average American will confess that he most wants success in his chosen field, and he wants success both for prestige and for financial security. The ominous thing about all this is that everything men and women want can be bought with money, and it would be difficult to think of an indictment more terrible than that! Real seekers after truth are almost as rare as albino deer! Why? Because truth is a glorious but hard master. Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the Truth,&rdquo; and followed Truth straight to the Cross. The Truth seeker must follow Him there and that is the reason few men seek the Truth!','Proverbs 10:22','The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.','Everything men and women want can be bought with money, and it would be difficult to think of an indictment more terrible than that!','Lord, may I always seek the truth.

He calls them to suffer; we call them to enjoy all the bourgeois comforts modern civilization affords! He calls them to holiness; we call them to a cheap and tawdry happiness that would have been rejected with scorn by the least of the Stoic philosophers!

My brethren, what does it mean to be loyal to Jesus Christ? To confess that Jesus Himself is more important to us than anything else in the world? Many find it hard to understand how large numbers of Christian believers could have died for their faith in our own generation! With a sense of distant admiration, we call them simple-hearted nationals. God calls them overcomers!

All of the former heroes of the faith are dead. You are alive in your generation. A Bible proverb says that it is better to be a living dog than a dead lion.

That is why Jesus taught that whosoever is willing to do His will shall have a revelation in his own heart. He shall have an inward revelation that tells him he is a child of God. Too many persons try to make Jesus Christ a convenience. They reduce Him simply to a Big Friend who will help us when we are in trouble. That is not biblical Christianity!

There should be a birth within, a birth from above. There should be the terror of seeing ourselves in violent contrast to the holy, holy God! Unless we come into this place of conviction and pain concerning our sin, I am not sure how deep and real our repentance will ever be. The man whom God will use must be undone, humble and pliable.

But they recoil from this radical, revolutionary break with the world. To follow Christ in this rough and thorough-going way is too much for them! Actually, the true Christian dissents from the world because he knows that it cannot make good on its promises. As Christ&rsquo;s believing disciple, he is not left without a &ldquo;norm&rdquo; to which he seeks to be adjusted. The Lord Jesus Christ is Himself the norm, the ideally perfect model; and the worshiping soul yearns to be like Him. Indeed, the whole drive behind the Christian life is the longing to be conformed to the image of Christ!','2 Corinthians 6:17','Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord . . .','The whole drive behind the Christian life is the longing to be conformed to the image of Christ!','Lord, help me to remember that you are the &ldquo;norm.&rdquo; As I endeavor to model myself after You, may I have the strength to be truly radical as You are.'),(209,'Renewed Day by Day','','','','The Worldly \"Virus\"','As Christian believers, we must stand together against some things.

We are against the world&rsquo;s ways and its false values. We are against the world&rsquo;s follies and its vain pleasures. We are against this world&rsquo;s greed and sinful ambitions. We are against this world&rsquo;s vices and its carnal habits. We believe this spells out clearly the Bible truth of separation. God asks us to stand boldly against anything or anyone who hurts or hinders this New Testament Body of Christians. Where the Church is not healed it will wither. The Word of God is the antibiotic that alone can destroy the virus that would plague the life of the Church!','Ephesians 4:31','Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor be put away from you.','God asks us to stand boldly against anything or anyone who hurts or hinders this New Testament Body of Christians.','Lord, help me to stand strong against those things, which Christianity cannot be.

The present competitive world and its selfish society have brought many new fears to the human race. I can sympathize with those troubled beings, who lie awake at night worrying about the possible destruction of the race through some evil, misguided use of the world&rsquo;s store of nuclear weapons. The tragedy is that they have lost all sense of the sovereignty and omnipotence and faithfulness of the living God. Although the material world has never understood it, our faith is well-placed in the Scriptures!

God is the Faithful One. We are to love Him and serve Him because He is God&mdash;not because of the gracious things He does for us or for the rewards He promises us! However, it should be said that God does not expect us to forget or ignore the gracious future promises He has made to us. It is a glorious truth that if we believe God and honor His Word, if we walk by faith in love and obedience, there will be eternal rewards for each of us in that great coming day. The rewards will differ. Wisdom and knowledge and love reside in Him who is our God. He will make the right judgments for His people. I for one will not be surprised if some of God&rsquo;s faithful people serving Him today should rise as high and shine as brightly as the heroes of faith listed in the book of Hebrews. I say that in all truthfulness, because I do not think that all of the heroes of faith are dead and gone!','1 Corinthians 3:8','Every man shall receive his own reward.','It is a glorious truth that if we believe God and honor His Word, if we walk by faith in love and obedience, there will be eternal rewards for each of us in that great coming day.','Lord, thank You for recognizing the work of Your saints.

The cross of Christendom is a &ldquo;no-cross,&rdquo; an ecclesiastical symbol. The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ is a place of death! Let each one be careful which cross he carries! Thousands turn away from Jesus Christ because they will not meet His conditions. He watches them as they go, for He loves them, but He will make no concessions. Admit one soul into the kingdom by compromise and that kingdom is no longer secure. Christ will be Lord, or He will be Judge. Every man must decide whether he will take Him as Lord now, or face Him as Judge then! &ldquo;If any man will . . . let him follow me.&rdquo; Some will rise and go after Him, but others give no heed to His voice. So the gulf opens between man and man, between those who will and those who will not. The Man, the kindly Stranger who walked this earth, is His own proof. He will not put Himself again on trial; He will not argue. But the morning of the judgment will confirm what men in the twilight have decided!','Colossians 1:20','Having made peace through the blood of his cross.','Let each one be careful which cross he carries!

Only the Lord of men could have risked the effect of such rigorous demands: &ldquo;Let him deny himself!&rdquo; Can the Lord lay down such severe rules at the door of His Kingdom? He can, and He does! If He is to save the man, He must save him from himself. It is the &ldquo;himself&rdquo; which has enslaved and corrupted the man. Deliverance comes only by denial of that self. No man in his own strength can shed the chains with which self has bound him, but in the next breath the Lord reveals the source of the power which is to set the soul free: &ldquo;Let him take up his cross.&rdquo; The cross was an instrument of death, slaying a man was its only function. &ldquo;Let him take his cross,&rdquo; said Jesus, and thus he will know deliverance from himself!','Galatians 6:14','The cross . . . by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.','No man in his own strength can shed the chains with which self has bound him, but in the next breath the Lord reveals the source of the power which is to set the soul free: &ldquo;Let him take up his cross.&rdquo;','Lord, let me die daily so that You may live.

They maintained that consciousness for the rest of their lives. How otherwise can the saints and prophets be explained? How otherwise can we account for the amazing power for good they have exercised over countless generations? Is it not that indeed they had become friends of God? Is it not that they walked in conscious communion with the real Presence and addressed their prayers to God with the artless conviction that they were truly addressing Someone actually there? Let me say it again, for certainly it is no secret: we do God honor in believing what He has said about Himself and coming boldly to His throne of grace than by hiding in a self-conscious humility! Those unlikely men chosen by our Lord as His closest disciples might well have hesitated to claim friendship with Christ. But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You are my friends!&rdquo;','Psalm 140:13','The righteous shall give thanks . . . the upright shall dwell in thy presence.','Let me say it again, for certainly it is no secret: we do God honor in believing what He has said about Himself and coming boldly to His throne of grace than by hiding in a self-conscious humility!','Lord, thank You so much for extending Your wonderful hand of friendship to me.

Yet there are segments of the Christian Church that appear to be poorly taught concerning God&rsquo;s clear remedy, through the atonement of Christ, for the believer who has yielded to temptation and failed his Lord. God knows that sin is the dark shadow standing between Him and His highest creation, man. God is more willing to remove that shadow than we are to have it removed! He wants to forgive and that desire is a part of God&rsquo;s character. In the sacrificial death of a lamb in the Old Testament, God was telling us that one day a perfect Lamb would come to actually take away sin. That is how and why God forgives sin now. In John&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins . . .&rdquo; (1 John 2:1&ndash;2a).','1 John 1:9','If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.','God is more willing to remove that shadow than we are to have it removed!','Lord, tear from me the cancerous sin that I am so unwilling to let go of.

Peter was not asking all the brothers and sisters to settle for some kind of regulated uniformity. He was recommending a spiritual unanimity&mdash;which means that the Spirit of God making Christ real within our beings will also give us a unity in certain qualities and disposition. Peter leaves little doubt about the fruits of genuine Christian unanimity within: &ldquo;Be alike in compassion. Be alike in loving. Be alike in pity. Be alike in courtesy. Be alike in forgiving!&rdquo; Then he sums it all up: &ldquo;Finally, be ye all of one mind!&rdquo; God&rsquo;s love shed abroad in our heart compassion and love, which can only be found in Jesus Christ. These are the only elements of true unity among men and women today!','1 Peter 3:8','Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren.','Be alike in compassion.

He told them that &ldquo;a man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.&rdquo; John was not referring to men&rsquo;s gifts; he was speaking of spiritual truth. Divine truth is of the nature of the Holy Spirit, and for that reason it can be received only by spiritual revelation. In his New Testament letters, the apostle Paul declares again and again the inability of human reason to discover or comprehend divine truth. In that inability we see human despair. John the Baptist said, &ldquo; . . . except it be given him from heaven&rdquo; &ldquo;and this is our hope! These words do certainly mean that there is such a thing as a gift of knowing, a gift that comes from heaven. Jesus promised His disciples that the Holy Spirit of truth would come and teach them all things. Jesus also prayed, &ldquo;I thank thee, O Father, because thou hast hid these things from the wise, and hast revealed them unto babes&rdquo; (Luke 10:21).','John 3:27','A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.','Divine truth is of the nature of the Holy Spirit, and for that reason it can be received only by spiritual revelation.','Lord, I pray that You will reveal to me to the truth that can only come from You.

Christmas tells us that Jesus was born, that He was born for the humiliation of suffering and death and atonement. But Easter is the radiant and glory-filled celebration of Christ&rsquo;s mighty triumph over the grave and death and hell! When Easter comes, our voices are raised in the triumphant chorus: The three sad days had quickly sped; He rises glorious from the dead! There is the real beauty! This is more than the beauty of color; more than the beauty of outline or form, more than the beauty of physical proportion. In the living Christ is the perfection of all beauty, and because He lives, we too shall live in the presence of His beauty and the beauties of heaven, forever!','Luke 24:5&ndash;6','Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen.','Easter is the radiant and glory-filled celebration of Christ&rsquo;s mighty triumph over the grave and death and hell!','Lord, I praise You for showing us Your power over the grave.

True spiritual power resides in the victory of the mighty, resurrected Lord of glory, who could pronounce after spoiling death: &ldquo;All power is given me in heaven and in earth.&rdquo; The power of the Christian believer lies in the Savior&rsquo;s triumph of eternal glory! Christ&rsquo;s resurrection brought about a startling change of direction for the believers. Sadness and fear and mourning marked the direction of their religion before they knew that Jesus was raised from the dead&mdash;their direction was toward the grave. When they heard the angelic witness, &ldquo;He is risen, as He said,&rdquo; the direction immediately shifted away from the tomb. &ldquo;He is risen, indeed!&rdquo; If this is not the meaning of Easter, the Christian Church is involved only in a shallow one-day festival each year. Thankfully, the resurrection morning was only the beginning of a great, vast outreach that has never ended&mdash;and will not end until our Lord Jesus Christ comes back again!','Matthew 28:18','Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.','True spiritual power resides in the victory of the mighty, resurrected Lord of glory, who could pronounce after spoiling death: &ldquo;All power is given me in heaven and in earth.&rdquo;','Lord, what a change it has made in our lives to know You are alive and well, and watching over us until You come back once more to receive Your bride.'),(220,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Resurrection: A Fact','The resurrection of Christ and the fact of the empty tomb are not a part of this world&rsquo;s complex and continuing mythologies.

The true church of Jesus Christ is necessarily founded upon the belief and the truth that there was a real death, a real tomb, and a real stone. But thank God, there was a sovereign Father in heaven, an angel sent to roll the stone away, and a resurrected living Savior, who was able to proclaim to His disciples, &ldquo;All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth!&rdquo; Brethren, He died for us, but ever since the hour of the resurrection, He has been the mighty Jesus, the mighty Christ, the mighty Lord! Our business is to thank God with tearful reverence for the Cross, but to go on to a right understanding of what the resurrection meant both to God and to men. We understand and acknowledge that the Resurrection has placed a glorious crown upon all of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings!','2 Peter 1:12, 16','Be established in the present . . . for we have not cunningly devised fables.','Brethren, He died for us, but ever since the hour of the resurrection, He has been the mighty Jesus, the mighty Christ, the mighty Lord!','Lord, when You defeated death and conquered sin; You displayed Your ultimate authority.

Are we just to listen to the bright cantata and join in singing, &ldquo;Up from the Grave He Arose,&rdquo; smell the flowers and go home and forget it? No, certainly not! It is truth and a promise with a specific moral application. The resurrection certainly commands us with all the authority of sovereign obligation&mdash;the missionary obligation! I cannot give in t&rdquo; the devil&rsquo;s principle, deceitful tactic, which makes so many Christians satisfied with an &ldquo;Easter celebration&rdquo; instead of experiencing the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. It is the devil&rsquo;s business to keep Christians mourning and weeping with pity beside the cross instead of demonstrating that Jesus Christ is risen, indeed. When will the Christian church rise up, depend on His promise and power, and get on the offensive for the risen and ascended Savior?','Philippians 3:10','That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection . . .','It is truth and a promise with a specific moral application.

All alone! But it can never be said that any true soldier of the cross of Jesus Christ, no man or woman as missionary or messenger of the Truth has ever gone out to a ministry alone! There have been many Christian martyrs, but not one of them was on that mission field alone. Jesus Christ keeps His promise of taking them by the hand and leading them triumphantly through to the world beyond. We can sum it up by noting that Jesus Christ asks us only to surrender to His lordship and obey His commands. When the Spirit of God deals with our young people about their own missionary responsibility, Christ assures them of His presence and power as they prepare to go: All power is given unto Me! I am no longer in the grave. I will protect you. I will support you. I will go ahead of you. I will give you effectiveness for your witness and ministry. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations &ldquo;I will never leave you nor forsake you!&rdquo;','Matthew 28:20','And, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.

When the Christian Church surrenders her once lofty concept of God and substitutes for it ideas so low, so ignoble as to be utterly unworthy, her situation is tragic indeed. Into the life and the practices of the Church comes a whole new philosophy; and the sense of the divine Presence and the majesty of God are no longer known. Although &ldquo;morality&rdquo; is no longer a popular word in our world, it is apparent that such low and unworthy concepts of God&rsquo;s Person actually constitute a moral calamity for professed believers in great segments of Christianity. The records of both sacred and secular history show that low views of God will surely destroy the appeal of the Christian for all who hold them! To all sinners, Jesus said, &ldquo;You must be born again&mdash;from above!&rdquo; He knew that the gods begotten in the shadowy thoughts of the fallen sons and daughters of Adam will quite naturally be no true likeness of the true and living God!','Psalm 50:1, 21','The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken . . . thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself.','The records of both sacred and secular history show that low views of God will surely destroy the appeal of the Christian for all who hold them!','Lord, I will accept no substitute.

We spend time describing the sinner&rsquo;s woes and the great burden he carries until we almost forget the principal fact that the sinner is actually a rebel against properly constituted authority! That is what makes sin SIN! We are rebels; we are sons of disobedience. Sin is the breaking of the Law, and we are fugitives from the just laws of God while we are sinners. We are fugitives from divine judgment. But thankfully, the plan of salvation reverses that and restores the original relationship so that the first thing the returning sinner does is confess, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and in Thy sight, and I am no more worthy to be called Thy son. Make me as one of Thy hired servants!&rdquo; Thus, in repentance, we reverse that relationship and we fully submit to the Word of God and the will of God as obedient children!','James 1:15','Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.','We are rebels; we are sons of disobedience. Sin is the breaking of the Law, and we are fugitives from the just laws of God while we are sinners.

Jesus laid down the terms of Christian discipleship, and there are some among us who criticize, &ldquo;Those words of Jesus sound harsh and cruel.&rdquo; This is where we stand: receiving Jesus Christ into your life means that you have made an attachment to the Person of Christ that is revolutionary in that it reverses the life and transforms it completely! It is complete in that it leaves no part of the life unaffected. It exempts no area of the life of the total man. By faith and through grace, you have now formed an exclusive relationship with your Savior, Jesus Christ. All of your other relationships are now conditioned and determined by your one relationship to your Savior. To receive Jesus Christ, then, is to attach ourselves in faith to His holy person, to live or die, forever! He must be first and last and all!','Matthew 10:38','He that taketh not his cross . . . is not worthy of me.','Receiving Jesus Christ into your life means that you have made an attachment to the Person of Christ that is revolutionary, in that it reverses the life and transforms it completely!','Lord, receiving You into my life could never be anything less than revolutionary.

He provides both strong warning and loving encouragement, for there is always the danger of losing the race. But there is also the victor&rsquo;s reward awaiting those who run with patience and endurance. So there are important things each of us should know and understand about our struggles as the faithful people of God. For instance, it is a fact that the Christian race is a contest. But in no sense is it a competition between believers or between churches! As we live the life of faith, we Christians are never to be in competition with other Christians. The Bible makes this very plain! Christian churches are never told to carry on their proclamation of the Savior in a spirit of competition with other Jesus churches. The Holy Spirit tells us to keep our eyes on Jesus not on others who are also running the race!','Hebrews 12:1','Let us run with patience the race that is set before us.','The Holy Spirit tells us to keep our eyes on Jesus not on others who are also running the race!','Lord, help to remember that while I run this race, there are many teammates who run along side me.

Many in our congregations have grown older and yet are not one inch farther up the mountain than on that day when the sun first arose on them in conversion. In fact, some are not even as far advanced along the way with God as they were a few years ago. If these things are true, I can only conclude that there are &ldquo;common&rdquo; Christians&mdash;men and women who no longer hear the Lord speaking to them, as they should. Can they really think that this halfway Christian life is the best that we can know? In the face of what Christ offers us, how can we settle for so little? It is a tragedy of our time that so many are settling for less than the Lord is willing to give!','Revelation 3:1','I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.','In the face of what Christ offers us, how can we settle for so little?','Lord, I want all that You will give me.

Why, then, do we settle for those little pleasures that tickle the saintlets and charm the fancy of the carnal? It is because we once heard a call to take up the cross; but instead of following toward the heights, we bargained with the Lord like a street huckster! We felt an urge to be spent for Christ, but instead of going on, we started asking questions. We began to bicker and bargain with God about His standards for spiritual attainment. This is plain truth, not about unbelieving &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; but about those who have been born again and who dare to ask, &ldquo;Lord, what will it cost me?&rdquo;','1 Corinthians 3:1','I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.','Certainly, God is not honored by our arrested spiritual development&mdash;our permanent halfway spiritual condition.','Lord, as I die to myself, may I remember that You died for me.

First, he gives his readers the scriptural reasons for certain Christian actions and attributes. He provides the basis and reason, then he exhorts the readers to respond appropriately. We do not know if Paul was the human writer to the Hebrews, but the method of exhortation is like Paul&rsquo;s. We are assured that Christ is greater than Moses and the angels and that He purchased mankind&rsquo;s salvation. Then the exhortation&mdash;if all of these things are true, then we should continue to love one another; keep on praying for one another.

This bothers me greatly: &ldquo;Sinner, just put a nickel&rsquo;s worth of faith in the slot, pull down the lever, and take out the little card of salvation.&rdquo; Tuck it in your wallet and off you go&mdash;a justified believer! But really, my brother or sister, we are brought to God and to faith and to salvation that we might worship. We do not come to God that we might be automatic Christians stamped out with a dye!

I have found this to be a fact: every redeemed human being needs the humility of spirit that can only be brought about by the manifest Presence of God.

Have mercy on me!&rdquo; God forgave the Skid Row bum but sent the other man away, hardened, unrepentant, and unforgiven. We come to Him just as we are but in humble repentance. When the human spirit comes to God knowing that anything it receives will be out of God&rsquo;s mercy, then repentance has done its proper work! God promises to forgive and forget and to take that man into His heart and teach him that all of God&rsquo;s kindnesses are due to His mercy. What more can a sinner ask?','Titus 3:7','Being justified by his  . . . heirs according to the hope of eternal life.','We come to Him just as we are but in humble repentance.','Lord, I am so thankful that while I was filthy and unworthy, You cared enough to pick me up and clean me off when I repented. Now I am very blessed to wear a robe of righteousness.'),(233,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Seeking After Truth','We live in a mixed-up kind of world in which many people are not at all sure of what they believe or what they ought to believe. Some churches advertise that way&mdash;you do not have to believe anything; just be a seeker after truth. Some actually settle for poetry, siding with Edwin Markham who &ldquo;saw his bright hand sending signals from the sun.&rdquo; I, for one, never had any such signals from God. We have Bibles everywhere, and the gospel is preached faithfully. Yet men and women seek God in old altars and tombs, in dark and dusty places, and finally wind up believing that God is sending signals from the sun. Some folks get mad at me when I say that this kind of &ldquo;seeking after truth&rdquo; needs to be exposed. We need to double our efforts in telling the world that God is spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth. It must be the Truth of God and the Spirit of God! Far from being an optional luxury in our Christian lives, the presence and the power of the Holy Spirit is a necessity!','1 Corinthians 2:12','We have received . . . that spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.','We need to double our efforts in telling the world that God is spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.','Lord, give me strength to let people know that You are the only way to salvation. May I be used to point people away from vain attempts at fulfillment.'),(234,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Spiritual Testing','In the scriptural accounts, there are many examples of men and women being tested, and I think it is plain that the Holy Spirit rarely tells a believer that he is about to be tested. Abraham was being tested when the Lord asked him to take his only son up into the mountain. He thought he was being ordered. He did not know he was being tested. Peter was unconsciously tested. Paul was tested and tried. There does come a time when we have heard enough truth and the Holy Spirit says, &ldquo;Today this disciple is going to be tested.&rdquo; The people of Israel in their time of testing came to Kadesh-Barnea and instead of crossing into the Promised Land, they said, &ldquo;We will not go over!&rdquo; God simply let them make their own test and they flunked it! Are there any among us who have an honest desire to be Christlike? We should all be aware that every day is a day of testing. Some come to their own Kadesh-Barnea and turn back. What a solemn thought&mdash;that many of the persons whom God is testing will flunk the test!','Deuteronomy 5:32','Do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.','We should all be aware that every day is a day of testing.','Lord, may I face each test with only this&mdash;faith in the goodness of Your will. I know You want only the best for me, and I accept Your will for my life.'),(235,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Glorious Contradictions','God has revealed so many glorious contradictions in the lives and conduct of genuine Christian believers that it is small wonder that we are such an amazement to this world. The Christian is dead and yet he lives forever. He died to himself and yet he lives in Christ. The Christian saves his own life by losing it, and he is in danger of losing it by trying to save it. It is strange but true that the Christian is strongest when he is weakest and weakest when he is strongest. When he gets down on his knees thinking he is weak, he is always strong. The Christian is in least danger when he is fearful and trusting God and in the most danger when he feels the most self-confident. He is most sinless when he feels the most sinful, and he is the most sinful when he feels the most sinless. The Christian actually has the most when he is giving away the most; and in all of these ways, the Christian is simply putting into daily practice the teachings and example of Jesus Christ, his Savior and Lord!','Galatians 2:20','The life which 1 now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me.','It is strange but true that the Christian is strongest when he is weakest and weakest when he is strongest. When he gets down on his knees thinking he is weak, he is always strong.','Lord, keep me from the trap of self-confidence. Make me rely on You, and remind me how strong I am on my knees.'),(236,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Rejoicing In Trials','The Apostle Peter stated a great Christian truth in the form of an amazing paradox: the obedient Christian believer will continue to rejoice and praise God even in the midst of continuing trials and suffering in this earthly life! God&rsquo;s people know that things here on this earth are not all they ought to be, but they refuse to join the worry brigade. They are too busy rejoicing in the gracious prospect of all that will take place when God fulfills His promises to His redeemed children. This ability to rejoice is demonstrated throughout the Bible, and in the New Testament it rings forth like a silver bell! The life of the normal believing child of God can never become a life of gloom and pessimism, for it is the Holy Spirit of God who keeps us above the kind of gloomy resignation that marks the secularism of the day. We are still able to love the unlovely and to weep with those who weep, for in Peter&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;When Christ&rsquo;s glory shall be revealed you may be glad with exceeding joy!&rdquo;','1 Peter 4:13','But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings.','The life of the normal believing child of God can never become a life of gloom and pessimism, for it is the Holy Spirit of God who keeps us above the kind of gloomy resignation that marks the secularism of the day.','Lord, thank You for the reminder that I have not only been forgiven of everything imaginable, but that I have everything to look forward to.'),(237,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Confessing Our Love','Consider with me the appealing Old Testament story of the beautiful young woman in the Song of Solomon. Deeply in love with the young shepherd, the king, who demands her favor, also actively seeks her out. She remains loyal to the simple shepherd, who gathers lilies and comes to seek her and calls to her through the lattice. In many ways, this is a beautiful picture of the Lord Jesus, of His love and care for His Bride, the Church. In the scriptural account, she does turn her loved one away with simple excuses. But condemned in heart, she rises to go out and search for him. As she seeks, she is asked: &ldquo;What is he above others that you should seek him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, he is altogether lovely,&rdquo; she replies. &ldquo;He came and called for me, and I had not the heart to go!&rdquo; But at last she is able to confess, &ldquo;I have found him whom my soul loveth!&rdquo; He had been grieved but He was not far away. So it is with our Beloved&mdash;He is very near to us, and He awaits our seeking!','Song of Solomon 2:4','He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.','I have found him whom my soul loveth!','Lord, I am astonished at that fervor with which You have sought me. I will make no excuses for You; I will go without question wherever You will lead me.'),(238,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','\"As I Was, So I Will Be!\"','For all things, God is the great Antecedent! Because He is, we are and everything else is. We cannot think rightly of God until we begin to think of Him as always being there&mdash;and being there first! Joshua had this to learn. He had been so long the servant of God&rsquo;s servant Moses, and had with such assurance received God&rsquo;s word at his mouth, that Moses and the God of Moses had become blended in his thinking&rsquo;so blended that he could hardly separate the two thoughts. By association they always appeared together in his mind. Now Moses is dead and lest the young Joshua be struck down with despair, God spoke to assure him: &ldquo;As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee!&rdquo; Moses was dead, but the God of Moses still lived! Nothing had changed and nothing had been lost, for nothing of God dies when a man of God dies. &ldquo;As I was, so I will be.&rdquo; Only the Eternal God could say this!','Joshua 1:5','As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.','Because He is, we are and everything else is.','Lord, You are the one thing I can rely on.

We are impressed that he could resist the devil and find fellowship with his Creator-God, for he lived in a worldly society headed for destruction. Enoch&rsquo;s daily walk was a walk of faith, a walk of fellowship with God. The Scriptures are trying to assure us that if Enoch could live and walk with God by faith in the midst of his sinful generation, we likewise should be able to follow his example, because the human race is the same and God is the same! Beyond that, Enoch reminds us that the quality and boldness of our faith will be the measure of our preparation for the return of Jesus Christ to this earth. We walk by faith as Enoch did, and although it is now 20 centuries after Christ&rsquo;s sojourn on earth, we hold firmly to the New Testament promise that our risen Lord will return to earth again!','Genesis 5:24','Enoch walked with God . . . and God took him.','If Enoch could live and walk with God by faith in the midst of his sinful generation, we likewise should be able to follow his example, because the human race is the same and God is the same!','Lord, You are the Lord of Enoch just as You are the Lord of me.

It should be our concern that we hear and that we obey! The faith and deportment of the man Enoch compose a vivid picture of a powerful object lesson to encourage every believer in his or her faith. There is only one conclusion to be drawn&mdash;Enoch was translated into the presence of God because of his faith, and thus he escaped death! It is my strong conviction that Enoch&rsquo;s experience of translation is a type, or preview, of the coming rapture of the Church, the Bride of Christ, described in the Scriptures. It is evident that there was no funeral for Enoch. Perhaps members of his family did not fully understand his walk with God, but they could answer with the facts! &ldquo;He is gone! We thought he was extreme in his beliefs but now he is gone, and we are still here in a troubled world!&rdquo;','Hebrews 11:5','By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death . . . he had this testimony, that he pleased God.','It should be our concern that we hear and that we obey!','Lord, I pray that You will take us all home soon to be with You as Enoch is. I pray that You will find in us the faith that drew him to You.'),(241,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','A Man Sent From God','The Bible record is very plain when it assures us that John the Baptist was a man sent from God. Our generation would probably decide that such a man ought to be downright proud of the fact that God had sent him. We would urge him to write a book. Seminary leaders would line up to schedule him as guest lecturer. Actually, John the Baptist would never have fit into the contemporary religious scene in our day&mdash;never! He did not keep his suit pressed. He was not careful about choosing words that would not offend. He did not quote beautiful passages from the poets. The doctors of psychiatry would have quick advice for him: &ldquo;John, you really need to get adjusted to the times and to society!&rdquo; &ldquo;Adjust&rdquo; &ldquo;that is a modern word I have come to hate. It was never an expression used to speak about human beings until we forgot that man has a soul. Now we have weird guys with mental &ldquo;screwdrivers&rdquo; adjusting one person a little tighter and another a little looser. John needed no adjustment. He gladly stepped down so that all eyes could turn to Jesus, the Lamb of God!','Matthew 11:11','Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.','Actually, John the Baptist would never have fit into the contemporary religious scene in our day&mdash;never!

They actually think that somehow they are better off for having learned the doctrines of religion. God actually asks of us what He asked of Noah long ago! &ldquo;Demonstrate your faith in God in your everyday life!&rdquo; It is evident that God did not say to Noah, &ldquo;I am depending on you to hold the proper orthodox doctrines. Everything will be just fine if you stand up for the right doctrines.&rdquo; I have read a statement by Martin Lloyd-Jones, the English preacher and writer, in which he said: &ldquo;It is perilously close to being sinful for any person to learn doctrine for doctrine&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; I agree with his conclusion that doctrine is always best when it is incarnated-when it is seen fleshed out in the lives of godly men and women. Our God Himself appeared at His very best when He came into our world and lived in our flesh!','John 6:63','It is the spirit that quickeneth . . . the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.','Demonstrate your faith in God in your everyday life!','Lord, remind me as I study Your word that I am nothing if I just know what to do and do not do it.

Lord, my Lord, Thou hast stooped to honor me to be Thy servant. No man taketh this honor upon himself save he that is called of God, as was Aaron. Thou hast ordained me Thy messenger to them that are stubborn of heart and hard of hearing. They have rejected Thee, the Master and it is not to be expected that they will receive me, the servant. My God, I shall not waste time deploring my weaknesses nor my unfittedness for the work. The responsibility is not mine but Thine. Thou hast said, &ldquo;I know thee; I ordained thee; I sanctified thee.&rdquo; Who am I to argue with Thee or to call into question Thy sovereign choice? The decision is not mine but Thine. So be it, Lord; Thy will, not mine be done.','John 15:16','Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.','No man taketh this honor upon himself save he that is called of God, as was Aaron.','Lord, thank You for choosing me to be Your servant.

And what is the devotional mood? It is nothing else than constant awareness of God&rsquo;s enfolding presence, the holding of inward conversations with Christ, and private worship of God in spirit and in truth! To establish our hearts in the devotional mood we must abide in Christ, walk in the Spirit, pray without ceasing, and meditate in the Word of God day and night. Of course this implies separation from the world and obedience to the will of God, as we are able to understand it. No matter how we may argue, true holiness and spiritual power are not qualities that can be once received and thereafter forgotten, as one might wind a clock or take a vitamin pill. Every advance in the spiritual life must be made against the determined resistance of the world, the flesh, and the devil!','Ephesians 6:10','Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.','The maintenance of the devotional mood is indispensable to success in the Christian life.','Lord, as I strive today to grow in You, keep me focused on the goal. Help me to remember to keep a devotional mood.'),(245,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Practicing The Truth','Christians habitually weep and pray over beautiful truth only to draw back from that same truth when it comes to the difficult job of putting it into practice! Actually, the average church simply does not dare to check its practices against biblical precepts. It tolerates things that are diametrically opposed to the will of God, and if the matter is pointed out to its leaders, they will defend its unscriptural practices with a casuistry equal to the verbal dodging of the Roman moralists. Can it be that there is no vital connection between the emotional and the volitional departments of life? Since Christ makes His appeal directly to the will, are we justified in wondering whether or not these divided souls have ever made a true commitment to the Lord? Or whether they have been inwardly renewed? It does appear that too many Christians want to enjoy the thrill of feeling right but not willing to endure the inconvenience of being right! Jesus Himself left a warning: &ldquo;Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead&rdquo; (Revelation 3:1b).','James 4:8','Cleanse your hands... and purify your hearts, ye double minded.','Since Christ makes His appeal directly to the will, are we justified in wondering whether or not these divided souls have ever made a true commitment to the Lord?

I am just of the opinion that we are often too casual, and there are too many tricks that can be used to make soul-winning encounters completely &ldquo;painless&rdquo; and at &ldquo;no cost&rdquo; and without any &ldquo;inconvenience.&rdquo; Some of the unsaved with whom we deal on the &ldquo;quick and easy&rdquo; basis have such little preparation and are so ignorant of the plan of salvation that they would be willing to bow their heads and &ldquo;accept&rdquo; Buddha or Zoroaster if they thought they could get rid of us in that way. To &ldquo;accept Christ&rdquo; in anything like a saving relationship is to have an attachment to the Person of Christ that is revolutionary, complete, and exclusive! It is more than joining some group that you like. It is more than having enjoyable social fellowship with other nice people. You give your heart and life and soul to Jesus Christ, and He becomes the center of your transformed life!','Galatians 4:9','But now, after ye are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements?','You give your heart and life and soul to Jesus Christ, and He becomes the center of your transformed life!','Lord, You have indeed transformed my whole life.

This kind of philosophy in soul winning&mdash;the idea that it is &ldquo;the easiest thing in the world to accept Jesus&rdquo; &ldquo;permits the man or woman to accept Christ by an impulse of the mind or of the emotions. It allows us to gulp twice and sense an emotional feeling that has come over us, and then say, &ldquo;I have accepted Christ.&rdquo; These are spiritual matters about which we must be legitimately honest and in which we must seek the discernment of the Holy Spirit. These are things about which we cannot afford to be wrong; to be wrong is still to be lost and far from God. Let us never forget that the Word of God stresses the importance of conviction and concern and repentance when it comes to conversion, spiritual regeneration, and being born from above by the Spirit of God!','John 3:7','Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.','There are far too many among us who have thought that they accepted Christ, but nothing has come of it within their own lives and desires and habits!','Lord, thank You for reminding me of the importance of true conversion.

There will be a spiritual confirmation, an inward knowledge, or witness. This kind of confirmation and witness was taught and treasured by the great souls throughout the ages. Conscious awareness of the presence of God! I defy any theologian or teacher to take that away from the believing Church of Jesus Christ! But be assured they will try. And I refer not just to the liberal teachers. God has given us the Bible for a reason&rsquo;so it can lead us to meet God in Jesus Christ in a clear, sharp encounter that will burn on in our hearts forever and ever. When the Bible has led us to God and we have experienced God in the crisis of encounter, then the Bible has done its first work. That it will continue to do God&rsquo;s work in our Christian lives should be evident!','Hebrews 10:22','Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith.','God has given us the Bible for a reason&mdash;so it can lead us to meet God in Jesus Christ in a clear, sharp encounter that will burn on in our hearts forever and ever.','Lord, I believe that You have drawn us close to You because You wish to have fellowship with Your creation.

Christ did not teach that He would impose His teachings upon the fallen world. He called His disciples to Him and taught them, and everywhere throughout His teachings there is the overt or implied idea that His followers will constitute an unpopular minority group in an actively hostile world. The divine procedure is to go into the world of fallen men, preach to them the necessity to repent and become disciples of Christ, and after making disciples, to teach them &ldquo;the ethics of Jesus,&rdquo; which Christ called &ldquo;all things which I have commanded you.&rdquo; The ethics of Jesus cannot be obeyed or even understood until the life of God has come to the heart of a man or woman in the miracle of the new birth. The righteousness of the law is fulfilled in those who walk in the Spirit. Christ lives again in His redeemed followers the life He lived in Judea, for righteousness can never be divorced from its source, which is Jesus Christ Himself!','Acts 1:8','And ye shall be witnesses unto me.','In society is sin, and sin is hostility to God!','Lord, may I live by the ethics of Jesus. I pray that You will give me the strength to do always what is right and not necessarily what is popular.'),(250,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Faith And Experience','I insist that the effective preaching of Jesus Christ, rightly understood, will produce Christian experience in Christian believers. Moreover, if preaching does not produce spiritual experience and maturing in the believer, that preaching is not being faithful to the Christ revealed in the Scriptures. Let me say it again another way: the Christ of the Bible is not rightly known until there is an experience of Him within the believer, for our Savior and Lord offers Himself to human experience. When Jesus says, &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,&rdquo; it is an invitation to a spiritual experience. He is saying, &ldquo;Will you consent to come? Have you added determination to your consent? Then come; come now!&rdquo; Yes, our Lord gives Himself to us in experience. David says in Psalm 34: &ldquo;O taste and see that the Lord is good.&rdquo; I think David said exactly what he meant. Surely the Holy Spirit was saying through David: &ldquo;You have taste buds in your soul for tasting, for experiencing spiritual things. Taste and experience that God is good!&rdquo;','Psalm 34:8','O taste and see that the Lord is good.','The Christ of the Bible is not rightly known until there is an experience of Him within the believer, for our Savior and Lord offers Himself to human experience.','Lord, I want to experience You fully and completely.

This is a word of caution in the matter of Christian experience: there is no pattern or formula for identical Christian experiences. It is actually a tragic thing for believers to try to be exactly like each other in their Christian faith and life. I have probably been overly cautious about testifying to my own experiences because I do not want anyone to be tempted to try to copy anything the Lord has done for me. God has given each of us an individual temperament and distinct characteristics. Therefore, it is the office of the Holy Spirit to work out as He will the details of Christian experience. They will vary with personality. Of this we may be sure: whenever a person truly meets God in faith and commitment to the gospel, he will have a consciousness and a sharp awareness of the details of that spiritual transaction!','Ephesians 2:10','For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.','It is the office of the Holy Spirit to work out as He will the details of Christian experience.','Lord, You made me to be something special, and I love You for nurturing me and growing me to be just what You want.

A third question that we want Him to answer is: &ldquo;Will it be convenient?&rdquo; What must our Lord think of us if His work and His witness depend upon the security and the safety and the convenience of His people? No element of sacrifice, no bother, no disturbance&mdash;so we are not getting anywhere with God! We have stopped and pitched our tent halfway between the swamp and the peak. We are mediocre Christians!','Romans 12:1','I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.','What must our Lord think of us if His work and His witness depend upon the security and the safety and the convenience of His people?','Lord, I understand that there is no such thing as safe service, and I am very willing to follow You no matter the cost.'),(253,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Beyond Empty Profession','Preaching from the pulpit about the Christian &ldquo;deeper life&rdquo; does not automatically produce a deeper life church and congregation. The profession of men and women that they believe in &ldquo;the deeper Christian life&rdquo; is no assurance that their fellowship is actually a deeper life church. The deeper spiritual life many people say they want is not a message; it is not a sermon; it is not a profession. I am a pastor, and I think I major in telling the truth. It is true that it is about time we stop coddling and apologizing for congregations that have reputations for being deeper life churches. The deeper spiritual life is not something just to be talked about&mdash;it is a quiet enjoyment of daily blessing, peace, and victory that is lived day by day beyond empty profession and without any two-faced circumstances!','2 Corinthians 13:5','Examine yourself whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.','The deeper spiritual life is not something just to be talked &ldquo;it is a quiet enjoyment of daily blessing, peace, and victory that is lived day by day beyond empty profession and without any two-faced circumstances!','Lord, I do not want to have to apologize to you for how I served You and worshiped You while I had a life to do it.

Suppose I go into a hospital in need of a blood transfusion. After the staff has ministered to me and given their services, do I just slip out with a cheery &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; as though I owe them nothing and it was kind of them to help me in my time of need? That may sound far out to you, but it draws a picture of attitudes among us today. But the Bible never in any way gives us such a concept of salvation. Nowhere are we ever led to believe that we can use Jesus as a Savior and not own Him as our Lord. He is the Lord, and, as the Lord, He saves us because He has all of the offices of Savior, Christ, High Priest, and Wisdom and Righteousness and Sanctification and Redemption! He is all of these&mdash;and all of these are embodied in Him as Christ, the Lord!','Colossians 2:6','As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.','Nowhere are we ever led to believe that we can use Jesus as a Savior and not own Him as our Lord.','Dear Jesus, You are my Lord as much as Savior.

When Jesus talked of His coming death, asking God to glorify His name through it, there came &ldquo;a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again&rdquo; (John 12:28). And what were the reactions of the bystanders? &ldquo;The crowd that was there heard it and said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him&rdquo; (John 12:29). People prefer their own logic, their own powers of reason. Even when God speaks, they refuse to recognize His voice. They will not confess that God has spoken through Jesus Christ, the eternal Son. When He confronts them with their sin, they consult a psychiatrist and hope they can get their personalities &ldquo;properly adjusted.&rdquo; But in a coming day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of all!','Psalm 85:8','I will hear what God the Lord will speak . . . peace unto his people.','People prefer their own logic, their own powers of reason.

People saw themselves as guilty and unclean by comparison! In the Book of Revelation, the apostle John describes the overwhelming nature of his encounter with the Lord of glory. Although a believer and an apostle, John sank down in abject humility and fear when the risen, glorified Lord Jesus appeared before him on Patmos. Our glorified Lord did not condemn John. He knew that John&rsquo;s weakness was the reaction to revealed divine strength. He knew that John&rsquo;s sense of unworthiness was the instant reaction to absolute holiness. Along with John, every redeemed human being needs the humility of spirit that can only be brought about by the manifest presence of God. Jesus at once reassured John, stooping to place a nail-pierced hand on the prostrate apostle, and saying, &ldquo;Do not be afraid. I am the Living One. I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and hades&rdquo; (Revelation 1:18).','Revelation 1:17','And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.','Our glorified Lord did not condemn John.

I am just a man with faults and shortcomings of my own, and I must always consider myself lest I be tempted! I preach to my own congregation about our faults and our failings, with the warning that some of our professions of blessing and victory may get into the area of &ldquo;unintentional hypocrisy.&rdquo; Through the grace of God and the kindness of our spiritual ancestors, we may have spiritual light that some others do not have. But in all honesty, we are wretchedly far below what we should be in living up to it day by day. It helps us to be honest, frank, and humble to know that the great God Almighty knows the secrets of every person&rsquo;s heart!','Romans 14:13','Let us therefore not judge one another anymore.','Our Lord Jesus Christ is the only man I know who was holy and perfect enough to call the religious leaders of the day hypocrites.','Lord, You are the Judge; You have things under control.

True worship must be a constant and consistent attitude or state of mind within the believer, a sustained and blessed acknowledgement of love and admiration. If we have this awareness in our own lives and experience, then it is evident that we are not just waiting for Sunday to come to church and worship. Having been made in His image, we have within us the capacity to know God and the instinct that we should worship Him. The very moment that the Spirit of God has quickened us to His life in regeneration, our whole being senses its kinship to God and leaps up in joyous recognition! That response within our beings, a response to the forgiveness and pardon and regeneration, signals the miracle of the heavenly birth, without which we cannot see the Kingdom of God. Thus the primary work of the Holy Spirit is to restore the lost soul to intimate fellowship with God through the washing of regeneration.','I Thessalonians 2:12','Walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.','True worship is not something that we &ldquo;do&rdquo; in the hope of appearing to be religious!','Lord, I worship You because I can do nothing else.

Holy Spirit, all divine, Dwell within this heart of mine. Cast down every idol throne; Reign supreme and reign alone.&rdquo; Our world is filled with hatred and conflict, violence and bloodshed. Through the plan of redemption God has dealt graciously with this global problem of hatred in the hearts of men and women. He has sent the source of love and light and radiance to the human bosom; Paul himself testified: &ldquo;The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to us&rdquo; (Romans 5:5).','1 John 5:6','It is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.','God has sent the source of love and light and radiance to the human bosom.','Lord, thank You so much for the light that is Jesus.

Included in their numbers are Bible teachers who are guilty of leading us astray. They have dared to teach Christians that the Holy Spirit will never speak of His own person or position, as though the third Person of the Godhead may be ignored and His ministry downgraded! Jesus said, &ldquo;[When He comes] He shall not speak of himself, but whatever He shall hear, that shall He speak&rdquo; (John 16:13b). Jesus was actually telling His disciples that the Comforter will not come to stand on His own to speak on His own authority; He will guide you into all truth. He will speak and act on the authority of the divine Godhead: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. If you do not yield and honor the Holy Spirit, your lives will not show forth the blessed fruits of the Spirit!','Ephesians 4:30','Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.','The Comforter will not come to stand on His own, to speak on His own authority; He will guide you into all truth.

Oh, how I want to keep that sensitivity within me&mdash;within my soul! I am thinking about a great throng of men and women raised in Christian homes. They have been brought up in Sunday school. They probably cut their first baby tooth on the edge of a hymnbook when the mother was not watching. Still, to this day, they are not right with God. Some have made a kind of profession but have never been able to delight themselves in the Lord. The reason? They have lost sensitivity to the message and the voice of God.

He promised that they would receive the Person of the Holy Spirit to carry out His plan of world evangelization. After Pentecost, the Spirit brought them a new and vivid consciousness of the actual presence of God. He gave them the gifts of divine joy and peace. He gave them great and continuing delight in prayer and communion with God! Finally, we recall that before Pentecost, the disciples could only ask questions. After Pentecost, throughout the record in the book of Acts, they stood in the authority of the Spirit and answered all of the questions of the people concerning God&rsquo;s plan of salvation through the crucified and risen Christ!','Acts 1:8','But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses.','As we read the New Testament, we find a very simple, very plain, and very forceful truth&mdash;the Holy Spirit makes a difference!','Lord, I cannot imagine my life without the Holy Spirit.

With Jewish critics all around, Peter lifted his voice and said that all who were in Jerusalem on that day were seeing the fulfillment of prophecy&mdash;the words of Jesus that He would send the Holy Spirit after His death and resurrection and exaltation. &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; Peter cried, &ldquo;let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). Many have failed to note Peter&rsquo;s Pentecostal emphasis: the important thing in God&rsquo;s plan was the fact that Jesus had been exalted in heaven and that His glorification there had been the signal for the coming of the promised Holy Spirit. What a lesson! The Spirit does not have to be begged&mdash;He comes when the Savior is honored and exalted!','Acts 2:32&ndash;33','This Jesus . . . being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost.','The important thing in God&rsquo;s plan was the fact that Jesus had been exalted in heaven and that His glorification there had been the signal for the coming of the promised Holy Spirit.','Lord, I crave the Holy Spirit more than ever.

It was the continuing emphasis for believers that we must live to gear ourselves into things eternal and to live the life of heaven here on earth. We must yield our first obedience and loyalty to Jesus Christ, at any cost! Anything we try to offer God that is less than that really is a degradation of the Christian Church. Frankly, I would rather be a member of a group that meets in a little room on a side street than to be part of a great activity that is not New Testament in its doctrine, in its spirit, in its living, in its holiness, in all of its texture and tenor. The Spirit-filled and Spirit-led congregation will be a joyful people. Beyond that, it will be useful and caring and compassionate!

I know that many discouraged Christians do not truly believe in God&rsquo;s sovereignty. In that case, we are not filling our role as the humble and trusting followers of God and His Christ. And yet, that is why Christ came into our world. The old theologians called it &ldquo;theanthropism&rdquo; &ldquo;the union of the divine and human natures in Christ. This is a great mystery, and I stand in awe before it. The theanthropy is the mystery of God and man united in one Person, not two persons but two natures.

That is one of the great, betraying evidences of sin, and we have learned it straight from our first parents. We do not accept the guilt of our sin and iniquity. We blame someone else. If you are not the man you ought to be, you are likely to blame your wife or your ancestors. If you are not the young person you ought to be, you can always blame your parents. If you are not the wife you ought to be, you may blame your husband or perhaps the children. Sin being what it is, we would rather lay the blame on others. We blame, blame, blame!

By nature, men and women are unholy; and by practice we are unrighteous. That we are also unhappy is of small consequence. But it is of overwhelming importance to us that we should seek the favor of God while it is possible to find it and that we should bring ourselves under the plenary authority of Jesus Christ in complete and voluntary obedience. To do this is to invite trouble from a hostile world and to incur such unhappiness as may naturally follow. Add the temptation of the devil and a lifelong struggle with the flesh and it will be obvious that we will need to defer most of our enjoyments to more appropriate time!','Romans 5:12','And so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.','By nature, men and women are unholy; and by practice we are unrighteous.

Beyond that, it does not seem to be very well recognized that God&rsquo;s highest desire is for every one of His believing children to so love and so adore Him that we are continually in His presence, in spirit and in truth. Something wonderful and miraculous and life-changing takes place within the human soul when Jesus Christ is invited in to take His rightful place.

The world is for all of us not only what it is; it is what we believe it to be, and a tremendous load of wealth or woe ride on the soundness of our interpretation! In the earlier days, when Christianity exercised a dominant influence over American thinking, men conceded this world to be a battleground. Man, so our fathers held, had to choose sides. He could not be neutral; for him it must be life or death, heaven or hell! In our day, the interpretation has changed completely. We are not here to fight, but to frolic! We are not in a hostile foreign land; we are at home! It now becomes the bound duty of every Christian to reexamine his spiritual philosophy in the light of the Bible.

They will reach the goal far ahead of the rest. The truly humble person does not expect to find virtue in himself; and when he finds none, he is not disappointed. He knows that any good deed he may do is the result of God&rsquo;s working within him. When this belief becomes so much a part of any man or woman that it operates as a kind of unconscious reflex, he or she is released from the burden of trying to live up to the opinion they hold of themselves. They can relax and count upon the Holy Spirit to fulfill the moral law within them. Let us never forget that the promises of God are made to the humble: the proud man by his pride forfeits every blessing promised to the lowly heart, and from the hand of God he need expect only justice!','1 Peter 5:5','All of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility.','The truly humble person does not expect to find virtue in himself; and when he finds none, he is not disappointed.','Lord, give me a life that is Yours to work through.

There is no doubt that theirs was the greatest moral blunder in the history of mankind. He came to His own people and they rejected Him! Jesus taught frankly that He was asking His followers to throw themselves out on the resources of God. For the multitude, He was asking too much. He had come from God, but they received Him not! It seems to be a comfort to some Christians to sit back and blame and belabor the Jews, refusing to acknowledge that they have information and benefits and spiritual light that the Jews never had. It is surely wrong for us to try to comfort our own carnal hearts by any emphasis that Israel rejected Him.

I would say that it may grade anywhere from its basic element&mdash;the terror of the guilty soul before a holy God&mdash;to the fascinated rapture of the worshiping saint. There are few unqualified things in our lives, but I believe that the reverential fear of God, mixed with love and fascination and astonishment and adoration, is the most enjoyable state and the most purifying emotion the human soul can know.

God has always been the God of all grace, and He does not change. Immutability is an attribute of God; therefore, God at all times and in all of history must act like Himself! He is the God of all grace; therefore, the grace of God does not ebb and flow like the ocean tides. There has always been the fullness of grace in the heart of God.

The believer is not deceived into believing that the physical things we know and enjoy are the ultimate end in themselves.','1 Timothy 6:17','Nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.','If men and women do not know what materialism is, how can they be expected to join the battle?','Lord, I pray that You will remind me that it is the Creator, and not the created that matters in life.

I came into the Kingdom of God with joy, knowing that I had been forgiven. I have had people tell me very dogmatically that they will never allow &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; to have any part in their spiritual life and experience. &ldquo;Too bad for you!&rdquo; is my reply. I say that because I have voiced a very real definition of what I believe true worship to be&mdash;worship is to feel in the heart! In the Christian faith, we should be able to use the word &ldquo;feel&rdquo; boldly and without apology. What worse thing could be said of us as the Christian Church if it can be said of us that we are a &ldquo;feelingless&rdquo; people? I think we must agree that those of us who have been blessed within our own beings would not join in any crusade to &ldquo;follow your feelings.&rdquo; But if there is no feeling at all in our hearts, then we are dead!','Ephesians 5:19','Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord . . .','Worship is to feel in the heart!','Lord, I more than anyone know the joy of salvation.

We must agree that it is altogether unlikely that we know who our \"greatest\" men are. One thing is sure, however; the greatest man alive today is the best man alive today. That is not open to debate. Spiritual virtues run deep and silent. The holy and humble man will not advertise himself nor allow others to do it for him. The Christian who is zealous to promote the cause of Christ can begin by living in the power of God\'s Spirit, reproducing the life of Christ in the sight of men. In deep humility and without ostentation, he can let his light shine. To sum it all up: the most effective argument for Christianity is still the good lives of those who profess it!','1 Timothy 4:12','Be thou an example . . . in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.','The holy and humble man will not advertise himself nor allow others to do it for him.','Lord, I pray that I will spend my time living my life for your glory and not trying to look like I am living for you only to increase my own glory.

God said to Adam and Eve, \"Thou shalt not eat from this tree.\" Here was a divine requirement calling for obedience on the part of those who had the power of choice and will. When they disobeyed they usurped the right that was not theirs! The poet Tennyson must have thought about this, for he wrote in his In Memoriam, \"Our wills are ours, we know not how; our wills are ours to make them Thine! We know not how.\" Then Tennyson girds himself and continues, \"Yes, our wills are ours to make them Thine.\" As created beings, that is our only right&mdash;to make our wills the will of God, to make the will of God our will! God is sovereign, and we are the creatures. He is the Creator and therefore His is the right to command us with the obligation that we should obey. It is a happy obligation, I might say, for \"His yoke is easy and His burden is light!\" It is important to agree that true salvation restores the right of a Creator-creature relationship, acknowledging God\'s right to our fellowship and communion!','Acts 9:6','And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?','As created beings, that is our only right&mdash;to make our wills the will of God, to make the will of God our will!','Lord, there is no other power on earth that can match the force of Your will.

I blame faulty exposition of the New Testament for stopping many Christians dead in their tracks, causing them to shrug off any suggestion that there is still spiritual advance and progress beckoning them on. It is the position of some would-be teachers that everyone who comes into the Kingdom of God by faith immediately obtains all there is of God\'s spiritual provision. I believe that such a teaching is as deadly as cyanide to the individual Christian life. It kills all hope of spiritual advance and causes many believers to adopt what I call \"the creed of contentment.\" I am sure you agree with me that there is always real joy in the heart of the person who has become a child of God. Sound teaching of the Word will then hold out the goal of moving forward, emulating the Apostle Pau\'s desire to become a special kind of Christian!','Ephesians 3:19','&mdash;that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.','Why should a Christian \"settle down\" as soon as he has come to know the Lord?','Lord, I know that there is so much for me to learn and so many areas in which I need to mature.

They are called upon to pretend that they can have peace of mind within and that they can be relatively happy and make a big success of their human lives if they have youth and wealth and morality and high position. In that sense of what is going on all around us, David never had to apologize for writing that \"every man is a liar!\" The whole human concept of success and happiness and inner peace, based upon who we are and what we have, is completely false. The rich young ruler who came to question Jesus had wealth, morality, position, and youth. But his very first question gave the clue to his own inner emptiness of life: \"What good thing should I do, that I may have eternal life?\" He knew very well that there is not a person alive who has eternal youth or eternal position or eternal righteousness. So, like every other man, he had to make a choice!','Matthew 19:22','When the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.','The whole human concept of success and happiness and inner peace, based upon who we are and what we have, is completely false.','Lord, I know that I cannot truly live with joy apart from You.

Compromise is everywhere, but, actually, no real union between the world and the Church is possible. When the Church joins up with the world, it is the true Church no longer but only a pitiful hybrid thing but an object of smiling contempt to the world and an abomination to the Lord! Nothing could be clearer than the pronouncements of the Scriptures on the Christian\'s relation to the world. The confusion that gathers around this matter results from the unwillingness of professing Christians to take the Word of the Lord seriously. This whole thing is spiritual in its essence. A Christian is what he is not by ecclesiastical manipulation but by the new birth. He is a Christian because of a Spirit, which dwells in him. Only that which is born by the Spirit is spirit, no matter how many church dignitaries work on it!','John 17:15','Pray . . . that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.','When the Church joins up with the world, it is the true Church no longer but only a pitiful hybrid thing but an object of smiling contempt to the world, and an abomination to the Lord!','Lord, I pray that You will strengthen my resolve not to compromise my spiritual life with worldly values.

Every section of this earth that we buy and sell and kick around and take by force of arms is a part of Christ\'s world. He made it all, and He owns it all. Jesus Christ, the eternal Word, made the world. He made the very atoms of which Mary was made; the atoms of which His own body was made. He made the straw in the manger upon which He was laid as a newborn baby. Let me digress here. I hear an occasional devotional exercise on the radio, in which the participants solicit, \"Mary, mother of God, pray for us!\" It is only right that we should express our position based on the Word of God; and the truth is that Mary is dead, and she is not the \"mother of God.\" Mary was the mother of that tiny babe, for God in His loving and wise plan of redemption used the body of the virgin Mary as the matrix to give the eternal Son a human body. We join in giving her proper honor when we refer to her as Mary, mother of Christ.','Hebrews 1:12','God hath spoken unto us by his . . . by whom he made the worlds.','Every section of this earth that we buy and sell and kick around and take by force of arms is a part of Christ\'s world.

Where love like that exists, there can be no place for a second object. Yet popular Christianity has as one of its most effective talking points the idea that God exists to help people to get ahead in this world! The God of the poor has become the God of an affluent society. We hear that Christ no longer refuses to be a judge or a divider between money-hungry brothers. He can now be persuaded to assist the brother that has accepted Him to get the better of the brother who has not! Whoever seeks God as a means toward desired ends will not find God. God will not be one of many treasures. His mercy and grace are infinite, and His patient understanding is beyond measure. But He will not aid men in selfish striving after personal gain. If we love God as much as we should, surely we cannot dream of a loved object beyond Him that He might help us to obtain!','Matthew 24:12','And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.','Whoever seeks God as a means toward desired ends will not find God.','Lord, You are the master and I am the servant.

With that context, it has become apparent that Christian churches are not paying attention to the Ten Commandments. But Dwight L Moody preached often in the commandments. John Wesley said he preached the commands of the Law to prepare the way for the gospel. R. A. Torrey told ministers if they did not preach the Law they would have no response to the preaching of the gospel. It is the Law that shows us our need for the gospel of salvation and forgiveness! It is accurate to say that our binding obligation is not to the Old Testament Law. As sincere Christians we are under Christ\'s higher law&mdash;that which is represented in His love and grace. But everything that is morally commanded in the Ten Commandments still comprises the moral principles that are the will of God for His people. God\'s basic moral will for His people has not changed!','Psalm 40:8','I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.','It is the Law that shows us our need for the gospel of salvation and forgiveness!','Lord, thank You for Your law, which showed me how much I need you.

In such cases, I am forced to wonder about the quality of their worship. The word \"holy\" is much more than an adjective saying that God is a holy God. It is an ecstatic ascription of glory to the triune God. Everything that appears to be good among men and women must be discounted, for we are humans. Abraham, David, Elijah, Moses, Peter, and Paul&mdash;all were good men, but each had his human flaws and weaknesses as members of Adam\'s race. Each had to find his own place of humble repentance. Because God knows our hearts and our intentions, He is able to restore His believing children in the faith! So, we should be honest and confess that much of our problem in continuing fellowship with a holy God is that many Christians only repent for what they do, rather than for what they are!','1 Peter 1:18','Yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.','Many Christians only repent for what they do, rather than for what they are!','Lord, I know that I am a sinner saved by grace.

Moses had no hesitation in kneeling before the bush and worshiping God. Moses was not worshiping a bush; it was God and His glory dwelling in the bush whom Moses worshiped! This is an imperfect illustration, for when the fire departed from that bush, it was a bush again. But this Man, Christ Jesus, is eternally the Son. In the fullness of this mystery, there has never been any departure, except for that awful moment when Jesus cried, \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" (Matthew 27:46). The Father turned His back for a moment when the Son took on Himself that putrifying mass of sin and guilt, dying on the cross, not for His own sin but for ours. The deity and the humanity never parted; and to this day, they remain united in that one Man. When we kneel before Him and say, \"My Lord and my God, Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever,\" we are talking to God!','Exodus 3:2','Behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.','The deity and the humanity never parted; and to this day, they remain united in that one Man.','Lord, Your nature amazes me.

I can recall the first time I heard that statement in a quiet conversation with Harry M. Shuman, who for many years was the president of the The Christian and Missionary Alliance. He was a soft-spoken yet forceful man of God, rich in the wisdom of God\'s Word. We were talking of the serious issues of life and death. When he had something especially important to say, Dr. Shuman had an unusual way of lowering his voice and tilting his head just a bit. I can see him yet as he looked out from under his shaggy brows straight into my eyes. \"Remember, Tozer,\" he said, \"death is not the worst thing that can happen to a person!\" For the Christian, death is a journey to the eternal world. It is a victory, a rest, a delight. I am sure my small amount of physical suffering has been mild compared to Paul\'s, but I feel as Paul did: \"I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far\" (Philippians 2:23).','John 11:25','He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.','Death is not the worst thing that can happen to a believing Christian!','Lord, may I learn to live with anticipation for the day that I may shed this mortal coil, and in living may I glorify the name of the one who saved me from my wretched state.'),(292,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Truth Has A Soul','I believe there is a positive warning in the gospels that a person\'s faith may stand in the revealed Bible text and still be as dead as the proverbial doornail!

When the power of God moves in on the text and sets the sacrifice on fire, then you have genuine Christianity! We try to call that revival, but it is not revival at all. It is simply New Testament Christianity. People who thought they were saved get saved! People who have only believed in a code now have placed their faith and trust in Christ\'s person. It is not any deluxe edition of Christianity; it is simply New Testament Christianity having its place!','Matthew 11:27','Neither knoweth any man the father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son shall reveal him.','There is more than a body of truth, and if we do not get through to the soul of truth, we have only a dead body on our hands.','Lord, let us teach the lost the true nature of salvation.

First, accept the truth concerning yourself. You do not go to a doctor to seek consolation but to find out what is wrong and what to do about it. Then seek the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. Seek through Jesus Christ a right relationship to God and then insist upon maintaining a right relation to your fellow man. Set about reverently and honestly to amend your doings. Magnify God, mortify the flesh, simplify your life. Take up your cross and learn of Jesus Christ to die to this world that He may raise you up in due time. If you will do these things in faith and love, you will know peace&mdash;the peace of God that passes all understanding. You will know joy&mdash;the joy of resurrection. You will know, too, the comfort of the indwelling Spirit of God, for you have sought to do the will of God at any price!','Acts 16:29-3O','He came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas . . . and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?','You do not go to a doctor to seek consolation but to find out what is wrong and what to do about it.','Lord, I come to You as the Great Physician.

We need to remember \"the will is the seat of true religion in the soul.\" Nothing genuine has been done in a man or woman\'s life until his or her will has been surrendered in active obedience. It was disobedience that brought about the ruin of the race. It is the obedience of faith that brings us back again into the divine favor! It needs to be said that a world of confusion results from trying to believe without obeying! A mere passive surrender may be no surrender at all. Any real submission to the will of God must include willingness to take orders from Him from that time on. I keep wondering whether the Lord\'s ministers will again give to obedience the place of prominence it occupies in the Scriptures.','Romans 6:16','His servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness.','It was disobedience that brought about the ruin of the race. It is the obedience of faith that brings us back again into the divine favor!','Lord, I surrender my will to You.

Because He is what He is, we please Him most, not by frantically trying to make ourselves good but by throwing ourselves into His arms with all our imperfections and believing that He understands everything and loves us still. The God who desires our fellowship and communion is not hard to please, although He may be hard to satisfy. He expects from us only what He has Himself supplied. When He must chasten us, He even does this with a smile&mdash;the proud, tender smile of a Father who is bursting with pleasure over an imperfect son who is coming every day to look more and more like the One whose child he is! This is the best of good news: God loves us for ourselves. He values our love more than He values galaxies of newly created worlds.

To be sovereign, God must be the absolute, infinite, unqualified ruler in all realms in heaven and earth and sea. To be Lord over all the creation, He must be omnipotent. He must be omniscient. He must be omnipresent. With all that is within me, I believe that the crucified and risen and glorified Savior, Jesus Christ, is the sovereign Lord. He takes no orders from anyone. He has no counselors and no advisers. He has no secretary to the throne. He knows in the one effortless act all that can be known and He has already lived out our tomorrows and holds the world in the palm of His hand. That is the Lord I serve! I gladly own that I am His; glory to God!

When Jesus faced His bitter religious enemies as recorded in John 8, there was no pretending, nothing staged for dramatic effect. Jesus confronted them with these words: \"He that is of God heareth God\'s words. You, therefore, hear them not, because you are not of God!\" These were firm and severe words; His enemies answered with angry and insulting words. These men were mad; they were letting go. They had given up pretense. They were acting naturally now, showing what they were within. As humans, we are what we do! If what we do proves us to be wrong, then it is either despair or obtaining the help we need. Jesus came to change our natures.

Someone may try to give me credit for something they think I have done for God, but actually, God is doing it through His Holy Spirit&mdash;and using me as an instrument. There is no real sense in which we are able to do spiritual work of any kind without the Holy Spirit. We do know that the Apostle Paul said, \"If any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his\" (Romans 8:9b). But he also exhorted those early believers not to ignore the Spirit\'s gifts and to \"covet earnestly the best gifts.\" It is still important for us to fulfill the Spirit-given functions and capabilities, which are the spiritual birthright of every regenerated believer. We should not be looking around for some other way. God has given us in His Holy Spirit every gift and power and help that we need to serve Him!','1 Corinthians 12:7','But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.','There is no real sense in which we are able to do spiritual work of any kind without the Holy Spirit.','Lord, here I am; send me.

The woman of Samaria met our Lord at the well, and we ask, \"Why was Jesus willing to reveal so much more about Himself in this setting than He did in other encounters during His ministry?\" You and I would never have chosen this woman with such a shadow lying across her life, but Jesus is the Christ of God, and He could sense the potential within her innermost being. He gave her the secret of His Messiahship and the secret of the nature of God. Her frankness and her humility appealed to the Savior as they talked of man\'s need and the true worship of God by the Spirit of God. In Jesus\' day, His critics said in scorn: \"This man receives sinners!\" They were right, and He lived and died and rose again to prove it.

When we are living for the Lord and living to please and honor Him, eating our breakfast can be just as spiritual as having our family prayers. There is no reason for a committed Christian to apologize, \"Lord, I am awfully sorry but you know I have to eat now. I will be with you again just as soon as I am through.\" Well, we have a better way than that in our living for God, and we see as we consider His feeding of the 5,000 the meaning of His Lordship.

Too many of us want the Holy Spirit in order to have some gift&mdash;healing or tongues or preaching or prophecy. Yes, these have their place in that total pattern of the New Testament, but let us ever pray that we may be filled with the Spirit for a secondary purpose! Remember, God wants to fill you with His Spirit as an end in your moral life.

It is actually \"religion in overalls\"\"the external part of religion, and it has its own place in God\'s work and plan. But beyond that and superior to all of the externals in our religious experience is the spiritual essence of it all! It is that spiritual essence that I want to see enthroned in our communion and fellowship in the Church of Jesus Christ! We need the caution that much theology, much Bible teaching, and many Bible conferences begin and end in themselves. They circle fully around themselves, but when everyone goes home, no one is any better than he was before. We sorely need this caution about holding truth that begins and ends in itself.

Like the lion in the cage, he paces back and forth and roars to the heavens before he dies. I think this is the truth: we are disturbed because God has put everlastingness in our hearts. He has put a longing for immortality in our beings, something that demands God and heaven. Yet, we are too blind and sinful to find Him or even to look for Him! As Christian witnesses, we must be faithful and timely in our preaching and teaching. There is a note of warning in this&mdash;telling men and women why they are lost and that if they will not repent they will certainly perish!','Isaiah 57:15','The high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity . . . with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.','He has put a longing for immortality in our beings, something that demands God and heaven.

I accept hard work and small rewards in this life. I ask for no easy place. I shall try to be blind to the little ways that could make life easier. If others seek the smoother path I will try to take the hard way without judging them too harshly. I shall expect opposition and try to take it quietly when it comes. Or if, as sometimes it falleth out to Thy servants, I should have grateful gifts pressed upon me by Thy kindly people, stand by me then and save me from the blight that often follows. Teach me to use whatever l receive in such manner that will not injure my soul nor diminish my spiritual power. Let me never forget that I am a man with all the natural faults and passions that plague the race of men. And if in Thy permissive providence honor should come to me from Thy Church, let me not forget that I am unworthy of the least of Thy mercies.','Romans 12:1','Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, [which is] your reasonable service.','Teach me to use whatever l receive in such manner that will not injure my soul nor diminish my spiritual power.','Lord, I surrender all to you&mdash;my will, emotions, intellect, and body.

'),(305,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Warning In The Gospel','When God warns a nation or a city, a church or a person, it is a grievous sin to ignore such warning. In conservative Christianity, we believe that the Christian message does indeed contain an element of alarm, but not all Christians believe this. Some have been taught that the Christian gospel is \"good news exclusively.\" They believe that the only way to explain the full meaning of the Christian gospel is to quote one verse: \"Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.\" \"That is it! That is all there is to it,\" they say. They surely need to be reminded that in the use of language, it is impossible to make certain definite statements without bringing to mind that which is exactly opposite. So, when the Scriptures admonish us to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved, there comes to our mind the fact of mankind\'s lost condition and the starkly plain message to those who do not believe: \"He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God\" (John 3:18).','John 3:18','He that believeth not is condemned already.','Some have been taught that the Christian gospel is \"good news exclusively.\"','Thank You, Lord, that it is by faith that we are saved, for there is nothing we can do to earn salvation. Help us to be transparent and honest about our weaknesses as we convey Your message to those who need You. '),(306,'Renewed Day by Day Volume II','','','','Critical Decisions','People have many different ideas about the most important moment of their lives on this earth. We know of many who have testified to the great importance of their own spiritual decision&mdash;the act of faith whereby they committed themselves and their entire futures to God! I believe the Bible makes it plain that the single most critical, most important time in the life of Abraham was when he heard and answered the call of God. Unexpectedly and dramatically, God revealed Himself to Abraham and called him to be a pilgrim. It is a lesson to us that when Abraham was called, he by faith obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going! I have found comfort in the doctrine of prevenient grace, which, simply stated, is the belief that before a sinner can seek God, God must first have sought him. In Abraham\'s case, I believe that if he had been insensitive, he would never have heard God\'s voice calling him, and if Abraham had rejected God\'s overtures, the whole history of the world would have been vastly different&mdash;and different for the worse!','Genesis 12:1, 4','The Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country. So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him.','Unexpectedly and dramatically, God revealed Himself to Abraham and called him to be a pilgrim.','Lord, You have called us to follow wherever You lead. By faith, we go, trusting Your sovereign hand on our lives. '),(307,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' One',' The Christian\'s Greatest Enemy','1','The Tyranny of the Customary','In the Old Testament, the enemy that threatened Israel the most was the dictatorship of the customary. Israel became accustomed to walking around in circles and was blissfully content to stay by the safety of the mountain for a while. To put it another way, it was the psychology of the usual. God finally broke into the rut they were in and said, \"You have been here long enough. It is time for you to move on.\" To put Israel\'s experience into perspective for our benefit today, we must see that the mountain represents a spiritual experience or a spiritual state of affairs. Israel\'s problem was that they had given up hope of ever getting the land God had promised them. They had become satisfied with going in circles and camping in nice, comfortable places. They had come under the spell of the psychology of the routine. It kept them where they were and prevented them from getting the riches God had promised them. If their enemy, the Edomites, would have come after them, the Israelites would have fought down to the last man and probably would have beaten the Edomites&mdash;Israel would have made progress. Instead they were twiddling their thumbs, waiting for the customary to keep on being customary.','Deuteronomy 1:5-7','Moses began to expound this law, saying: \"The LORD our God said to us at Horeb, \'You have stayed long enough at this mountain. Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorities.\'\"','After forty years there, life in the wilderness became customary for the people of Israel. Have we, too, become accustomed to life in the wilderness even though God calls us to move beyond into the life He has promised?','Lord, may I move on, closer and closer to You. Give me a holy dissatisfaction for the customary and a deepening heart hunger for You.'),(308,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' One',' The Christian\'s Greatest Enemy','2','A Church Cemented in the Routine','What is the worst enemy the church faces today? This is where a lot of unreality and unconscious hypocrisy enters. Many are ready to say, \"The liberals are our worst enemy.\" But the simple fact is that the average evangelical church does not have too much trouble with liberalism. Nobody gets up in our churches and claims that the first five books of Moses are just myths. Nobody says that the story of Creation is simply religious mythology. Nobody denies that Christ walked on the water or that He rose from the grave. Nobody gets up in our churches and claims that Jesus Christ is not the Son of God or that He isn\'t coming back again. Nobody denies the validity of the Scriptures. We just cannot hide behind liberalism and say that it is our worst enemy. We believe that evangelical Christians are trying to hold on to the truth given to us, the faith of our fathers, so the liberals are not our worst enemy. Neither do we have a problem with the government. People in our country can do just about whatever they please and the government pays no attention. We can hold prayer meetings all night if we want, and the government would never bother us or question us. There is no secret police breathing down our backs watching our every move. We live in a free land, and we ought to thank God every day for that privilege. The treacherous enemy facing the church of Jesus Christ today is the dictatorship of the routine, when the routine becomes \"lord\" in the life of the church. Programs are organized and the prevailing conditions are accepted as normal. Anyone can predict next Sunday\'s service and what will happen. This seems to be the most deadly threat in the church today. When we come to the place where everything can be predicted and nobody expects anything unusual from God, we are in a rut. The routine dictates, and we can tell not only what will happen next Sunday, but what will occur next month and, if things do not improve, what will take place next year. Then we have reached the place where what has been determines what is, and what is determines what will be.','Acts 2:43','Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.','The routine may be traditional or contemporary or a combination of the two. What shatters the routine is the awesome presence of the Lord. Do we miss Him?','Lord, shock us with a Holy Spirit invasion into our routine. Crack the cement and set us free to experience You in ways unexpected, in Jesus name.'),(309,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' One',' The Christian\'s Greatest Enemy','3','Mired in the \"Rote\"','Everybody knows just what will happen, and this has become our deadliest enemy. We blame the devil, the \"last days,\" and anything else we can think of, but the greatest enemy is not outside of us. It is within&mdash;it is an attitude of accepting things as they are. We believe that what was must always determine what will be, and as a result, we are not growing in expectation. As soon as someone begins talking like this, the Lord\'s people respond by getting busy. What I am talking about, however, is internal. It is a matter of the soul and mind that ultimately determines our conduct. Let me show you the progressive stages. I begin with what I will call the \"rote.\" This is repetition without feeling. If someday someone would read the Scripture and believe it and would believe what is sung in the great Christian hymns, there would be a blessed spiritual revolution underway in a short time. But too many are caught up in the rote, repeating without feeling, without meaning, without wonder and without any happy surprises or expectations. In our services God cannot get in because we have it all fixed up for Him. We say, \"Lord, we are going to have it this way. Now kindly bless our plans.\" We repeat without feeling, we repeat without meaning, we sing without wonder, and we listen without surprise. That is my description of the rote.','Matthew 17:20-21','He replied, \"Because you have so little faith, I tell you the truth. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, \'Move from here to there\' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\'\"','If there is faith that moves mountains there is also faith that keeps mountains from moving!','Oh Father, we want to let You be GOD! Forgive us for limiting You by our own misperceptions and feeble faith. Give us a glimpse of who You are!'),(310,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' One',' The Christian\'s Greatest Enemy','4','The \"Rote\" to \"Rutness\"','We can go one step further and come to what I will call the rut, which is bondage to the rote. When we are unable to see and sense bondage to the rote, we are in a rut. For example, a man may be sick and not even know it. The doctors may have confided in the man\'s wife and said, \"We don\'t want to frighten your husband, but he could drop any minute. He is critically ill, so just expect it at any moment.\" But the man himself does not know he is seriously ill. He goes about his business as though nothing is wrong. He may play golf or tennis, maybe even go on a hunting trip. He is sick, and yet he does not know how sick he really is. This may in fact hasten his end. Not knowing is risky business and full of danger. Spiritually speaking, the rut is bondage to the rote, and the greatest danger lies in our inability to sense or feel this bondage.','Mark 6:5-6','He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. And he was amazed at their lack of faith.','If we are not significantly aware of His presence, then we may be unaware of His absence. Do we still know the difference?','Father, free me to pursue You, with all of my heart, to pursue You. In Christ\'s name.'),(311,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' One',' The Christian\'s Greatest Enemy','5','Rot Sharing','There is a third word, and I do not particularly like to use it, but the history of the Church is filled with it. The word is rot. The church is afflicted by dry rot. This is best explained when the psychology of nonexpectation takes over and spiritual rigidity sets in, which is an inability to visualize anything better, a lack of desire for improvement. There are many who respond by arguing, \"I know lots of evangelical churches that would like to grow, and they do their best to get the crowds in. They want to grow and have contests to make their Sunday school larger.\" That is true, but they are trying to get people to come and share their rut. They want people to help them celebrate the rote and finally join in the rot. Because the Holy Spirit is not given a chance to work in our services, nobody is repenting. For the most part, spiritual rigidity that cannot bend is too weak to know just how weak it is. ','Revelation 3:1','\"To the angel of the church in Sardis write: \'These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds: you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.\'\"','This is best explained when the psychology of nonexpectation takes over and spiritual rigidity sets in, which is an inability to visualize anything better, a lack of desire for improvement.','Lord, help us to not become spiritually rigid, getting so caught up in the rote and rut that it turns to rot. Let us be ever mindful of Your presence, Lord.  When we lose our vision for more than the status quo in our churches, convict us, Holy Spirit, and bring us to our knees for revival. Amen.'),(312,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' One',' The Christian\'s Greatest Enemy','6',' Who is the Church?','For clarification, what is the church? When I say that a church gets into the rote and then onto the rut and finally to the rot, what am I talking about? For one thing, the church is not the building. A church is an assembly of individuals. There is a lot of meaningless dialogue these days about the church. It is meaningless because those engaged in the dialogue forget that a church has no separate existence. A church is not an entity in itself, but rather is composed of individual persons. It is the same error made about the state. Politicians sometimes talk about the state as though it were an entity in itself. Social workers talk about society, but society is people. So is the church. The church is made up of real people, and when they come together we have the church. Whatever the people are who make up the church, that is the kind of church it is—no worse and no better, no wiser, no holier, no more ardent and no more worshipful. To improve or change the church you must begin with individuals. When people in the church only point to others for improvement and not to themselves, it is sure evidence that the church has come to dry rot. It is proof of three sins: the sin of self-righteousness, the sin of judgment and the sin of complacency.',' 1 Corinthians 12:27','Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.','The Church is not them, it is us. Look in the mirror. You are the Church. We cannot expect from the Church greater spirituality, commitment and devotion than we ourselves are willing to live. We are the Church!',' O Christ, I want to be a body member through whom You can reach out to people. Live Your life through me!'),(313,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' One',' The Christian\'s Greatest Enemy','7',' Spiritual Smugness',' Self-righteousness is terrible among God\'s people. If we feel that we are what we ought to be, then we will remain what we are. We will not look for any change or improvement in our lives. This will quite naturally lead us to judge everyone by what we are. This is the judgment of which we must be careful. To judge others by ourselves is to create havoc in the local assembly. Self-righteousness also leads to complacency. Complacency is a great sin and covers just about everything I have said about the rote and the rut. Some have the attitude, \"Lord, I\'m satisfied with my spiritual condition. I hope one of these days You will come, I will be taken up to meet You in the air and I will rule over five cities.\" These people cannot rule over their own houses and families, but they expect to rule over five cities. They pray spottily and sparsely, rarely attending prayer meeting, but they read their Bibles and expect to go zooming off into the blue yonder and join the Lord in the triumph of the victorious saints.',' Revelation 3:17',' You say, \"I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.\" But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.',' Spiritual smugness can be a form of self-deception. Is it not also a symptom of spiritual retardation? It is with Christ we are to measure ourselves. Then we see ourselves for what we are.',' Deliver me, Lord, from complacency. But please don\'t shock me all at once with spiritual reality. For Jesus\' sake.'),(314,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' One',' The Christian\'s Greatest Enemy','8',' Fleeing the Rut','If we call Him Lord, how dare we sit any longer in the rut! The Lord has called us to move on. But when people are in a rut, not even the angel Gabriel can help them if they will not come out of it. This is not an accusation but a suggestion. If you are not in a rut, don\'t get mad—somebody else is. But if you are in a rut you ought to get out of it. The difference between a wooden leg and a good leg is that if you prick a wooden leg the person would never notice. The difference between a church that has dry rot and a church that is alive is that if you prick the live church it will respond. If you prick the other kind, it is already dead. The tree that stands alive has lush, green leaves. Take a knife, scar the bark deeply and the tree will bleed. It is alive. The old dead tree just stands there, a watchtower for old sentinel crows. Take your knife and dig in as far as you want to, and nothing will happen because the tree is dead. So it is with my message. If you will get neither mad nor glad nor sad under my preaching, I know nothing can be done. But there are some who are alive, and I believe it is the majority.',' John 10:10',' . . . I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.','He is there to lead us out of the rut into life, life to the full. We can walk out of the rut if we will. We can do it by His enablement.',' O Lord, forgive me for my \'rut-living.\' By faith I reach out to receive from You life to the full.'),(315,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Two',' Errors in Thinking','9',' Marching in Place','God in His condescending love and kindness often sends a Moses, or maybe a Joshua or an Isaiah, or in latter times a Luther or Wesley to show us that the work of the Lord is not progressing. Times are bad in the kingdom and getting worse. The tendency is to settle into a rut, and we must get out of it. The time has come to arise and go on from here because God\'s will is as broad as the land He gave to the Israelites—\"in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates\" (Deuteronomy 1:7). . . . I am quite sure that when the man of God thundered, \"You have stayed long enough in this place. You are going around in circles. Get you out and take what is given to you by the hand of your God,\" nobody got up and said, \"Mr. Chairman, let\'s eat something.\" Eating probably would not have helped. I am quite certain that they did not get up and say, \"Let\'s take a trip,\" or \"Let\'s start another club.\" Starting a club is another reaction we have when we find ourselves in a rut and realize we are no taller than we were five years ago; we are no farther along than we were five years ago; we don\'t know any more than we did five years ago; we are no holier than we were five years ago. We simply met ourselves coming around. If a song could be worn out, we have worn out the same old song: \"Revive us again, fill each heart with Thy love.\" We have sung that one and nobody means it—nobody will pay the price. But we go around and around, and all we see is the other fellow\'s heels just ahead of us. All the fellow behind us sees is our heels. We go around and around the circle, and somebody says, \"Let\'s start a club now.\"',' Deuteronomy 1:8','See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore he would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and to their descendants after them.','So easy to get absorbed in activity, \"Christian\" activity, \"church\" activity and find that you have been marching in place all the time. \"Go and take possession!\"',' Father, deliver me from feverish activity that avoids acts You desire.

There are three things they misunderstand. First, they misunderstand the nature of Christian faith. Christian faith is inward, not outward. It is of the spirit and not of the flesh. The kingdom of God is within you, Christ dwells in your heart, and \"Christ in you, the hope of glory\" (Colossians 1:27) is the burning core of the Christian faith. So Christianity, the true Christian faith, is inward in nature—we are to be inwardly Christians. It is inside, somewhere in the spirit, soul and heart—the inner person—that we get into the rut. Because the problem is inward, it is ridiculous to say, \"All right. The inner person, the spirit of me, the inner shrine of me, is in a rut. It isn\'t where it ought to be, so let\'s eat something.\"',' Colossians 1:27','To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.','The external can misrepresent the internal. We uphold appearances as a mirage that cloaks internal want. It is the fulness of the Spirit we lack, not rigorous religious routine.',' You are enthroned in my heart, O Christ. Grow me into what You want me to be. Being gives meaning to doing.'),(317,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Two',' Errors in Thinking','11',' On Being Church','First, they misunderstand the nature of Christian faith. . . . Second, they misunderstand the nature of the church. You see, the church is a body of individuals united in Christ but having separate individual responsibilites. Thus the body is improved only as we improve the individuals that compose the body. The Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost on approximately 120 people. But it fell on them individually, and if any had hardened themselves they would have been passed over. Each person is born individually even if he or she is one of a set of triplets. We are born one at a time, and we die one at a time; we face judgment one at a time and, if we as Christians are sick, we will be cured one at a time. The body is composed of individuals, and to say, \"All right, let\'s form committees to look into it,\" is trying to do by a dozen people what God cannot do for one person—fix the problem by external means. It does not work, and it will never work. Because we misunderstand the nature of the church, we misunderstand how to solve the problem.',' Romans 12:4-5','Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.','Each of us as a believer belongs to all other believers. We are members of the one body of Christ—the Church. Functions vary but we have one Head, Christ. Each of us submitting to Him and functioning as He has gifted us results in body health.',' Lord, help to live in light of my relation to You and to all other believers. I need them and they, in some measure, need me. Thank You for our oneness.'),(318,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Two',' Errors in Thinking','12',' Body Health Depends On Body Member Health','First, they misunderstand the nature of Christian faith. . . . Second, they misunderstand the nature of the church. . . . Third, they misunderstand what is wrong with them. You cannot cure a weak member by prescribing a certain diet. You can eat caviar and hummingbird tongue until the sun goes down, but it will not help you, because that is not what is wrong with you. Somebody else says, \"Let\'s take a trip.\" Take your trip—it is all right. Try not to get killed on the way. But remember, that is not what is wrong with you. Somebody else says, \"Let\'s start a committee to handle it.\" The lack of a committee is not what is wrong with you, either. You are missing the nature of true Christian faith, for true Christianity is inward, and what is wrong cannot be reached by these external means. Now suppose we are ready to admit that we are in a rut. You say, \"Well, what is the church doing?\" I don\'t know, because it is the individual that matters. You see, the church is composed of this fellow that lives out here a little way and those two people who live out there in Scarboro and the five who live in Rexdale and the seven who live up in Willowdale and the 14 who live out east. That is the church. What the church does is what the individuals do. How well or how sick the church is depends on how well or how sick the individuals are. In other words, it depends upon how you are. We must come to the Lord and say, \"Oh, Lord, what do I still lack? I have some things, Lord, but what do I lack? Or what is it that I ought to get rid of? How do I compare with what I should be? How do I know what I should be?\"',' Ephesians 5:29-30','After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church—for we are members of his body.','The Church can only be as healthy as the individual members who compose it. A local church is a local expression of the Church. Church health depends on our health—yours and mine.',' By Your Spirit through Your Word, show me my heart need, Lord. I want to be a body member through whom You can reach out in this world.'),(319,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Two',' Errors in Thinking','13',' God\'s Blueprint for Believers\' Living','In Matthew 5:3-10 we read:  Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  That is what we ought to be. This passage tells what a true Christian should be like. Go on to the epistles and see what the man of God has to say there. In Ephesians 4:26—5:2 he says, \"In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold. He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need. Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.  This is what we ought to be.\" This is the way we ought to be living. When we say, \"Lord, what do I still lack?\" the Holy Spirit answers, \"This is what you lack.\"',' Ephesians 3:20-21','Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever!

God being who He is, and Jesus Christ being His risen and all-powerful Son, anything we ought to be we can be. Anything that God has declared that we should be we can be. In the wonderful book of Romans, perhaps the greatest and most profound book in the Bible, 7 tells us of a man who is struggling and wanting to be something that he feels he cannot be. Finally he gives up and says, \"What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?\" (verse 24). Immediately, Paul says, \"Thanks be to God! . . . because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death\" (25; 8:2). In Galatians 5:22-23 we read, \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.\" That is what we ought to be and what we can be. Now compare that with what we are.',' Galatians 5:16','So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.','As we walk step-by-step by means of the Spirit, he produces in us the product of His control—the fruit of the Spirit.

If we compare what we ought to be and could be with what we are, and we don\'t see that we are in a rut and we are not concerned, then one of three things may be wrong. First, we may not be converted at all. I am convinced that many evangelicals are not truly and soundly converted. Among the evangelicals it is entirely possible to come into membership, to ooze in by osmosis, to leak through the cells of the church and never know what it means to be born of the Spirit and washed in the blood. A great deal that passes for the deeper life is nothing more or less than basic Christianity. There is nothing deeper about it, and it is where we should have been from the start. We should have been happy, joyous, victorious Christians walking in the Holy Spirit and not fulfilling the lusts of the flesh. Instead we have been chasing each other around the perpetual mountain. What we need is what the old Methodists called a sound conversion. There is a difference between conversion and a sound conversion. People who have never been soundly converted do not have the Spirit to enlighten them. When they read the Sermon on the Mount or the teaching passages of the epistles that tell them how to live or the doctrinal passages that tell how they can live, they are unaffected. The Spirit who wrote them is not witnessing in their hearts because they have not been born of the Spirit. That often happens.',' John 3:36',' Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God\'s wrath remains on him.',' Trying to live without life.

Perhaps they have been regenerated but have sinned against light too often, so the light has become darkness. That often happens. I don\'t say these people are lost, but I do say that they are in a terrible state. Only the power and grace of God working within them can help. I think there are lots of people like that. They have been regenerated, but they have become busy with their real estate office or their store. Many have said, \"Well, I\'d like to come to your church, Reverend, but I have to keep my store open seven days a week.\" They cannot serve God because they do not have time to serve Him. They will have time to die, but they do not have time to serve God.',' Hebrews 12:1,2','Therefore . . . let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith . . .','Ever seen a marathon runner at the starting line with a 300 pound refrigerator strapped to his back? We can\'t run the race unless we throw off weights and the sin that so easily entangles.',' Those things that hinder my running, that sin to which I am so vulnerable—I would throw them off, Lord, and run with my eyes on You!'),(323,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Two',' Errors in Thinking','17',' The Blindness of Self-Righteousness',' . . . If we compare what we ought to be and could be with what we are, and we don\'t see that we are in a rut and we are not concerned, then one of three things may be wrong. First, we may not be converted at all. . . . Second, people may not be concerned about the rut because of sin they have committed. . . . Third, some people are so self-righteous that they are impervious to any work of the Holy Spirit. They cannot be cured of their blindness because they think they see. The Pharisees never got under conviction. They crucified Christ, they hated the Son of God, but they never got under conviction. They had ordered their religious life so as to be impervious to the arrows of the Holy Spirit. The adulterous woman could fall at the feet of Jesus, the tax collector who knew he had been crooked could run to the feet of Jesus to ask for help, and the poor came from everywhere to say, \"What must I do?\" They could come, but the Pharisees never did. They never got under conviction, and in hell I suppose they are still fighting and saying they are right. If people judge what they could be and ought to be with what they are and can still go home and have a good night\'s rest, shrugging it off, perhaps they have never been converted. Maybe they have sinned against light until they are temporarily under a terrible cloud of God\'s judgment. Or maybe they are so self-righteous that they cannot get under conviction.',' Luke 5:8',' When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus\' knees and said, \"Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!\"',' It is only as we draw near to Jesus that we realize how filthy sinful we are. His glorious light reveals the dark closets of our heart. We can only fall before Him. Amazing love! He does not turn us away!',' O God, burn away my self-righteousness as You let me look upon You. Vile and full of sin I am. You are light and truth and righteousness. I worship You!'),(324,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Two',' Errors in Thinking','18',' Renewal Prayer',' The children of the world are sometimes wiser than the children of light. . . . We have been offered the face of God and the glory of Christ. We have been offered holiness and righteousness and indwelling by the Spirit. We can have our prayers answered and have hell fear us because we have a hold on God who invites us to draw on His omnipotence. We are offered all this, and yet we sit and play second violin without ambition. Israel was once in that condition, and an old prophet with shining eyes came to them and said, \"Woe to you who are complacent in Zion, and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria. . . You put off the evil day and bring near a reign of terror. You lie on beds inlaid with ivory and lounge on your couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened calves. You strum away on your harps like David and improvise on musical instruments. You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile\" (Amos 6:1-7). Israel was in a rut, and they did not want anybody disturbing their calm. They liked music and food and beds of ivory, and they anointed themselves with ointment. They had everything that we call sumptuous living. But they were not grieved at the affliction of Israel. They didn\'t care. Let us not rest upon beds of ivory. By the grace of God let us begin to grieve a bit for the affliction of Joseph and be anxious and bothered in the Holy Spirit for the state the church is in.',' Psalm 85:6',' Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?',' We can only be used in the awakening of the Church as we walk daily by the Spirit so that Christ lives through us. We can be a spark of light that ignites others.',' O Breath of Life, come sweeping through us, revive Thy church with life and power. And blow upon me, O God.'),(325,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Three',' Awakened Out of Sleep','19',' Moral Sleep','My aim is to awaken some from the rut. I know it is impossible to awaken everybody, but I hope to awaken some. I use the word awaken here advisedly and carefully because the Bible contains significant teaching gathered around the word sleep. There is first of all natural sleep. \"He grants sleep to those he loves\" (Psalm 127:2). \"I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety\" (Psalm 4:8). . . . I am thinking of moral sleep and spiritual sleep. Moral sleep is suggested in First Corinthians 15:34, \"Awake to righteousness and sin not\" (KJV). There is such a thing as moral sleep. It is entirely possible to be displeasing God and grieving the Holy Spirit by being asleep morally; that is, by permitting what should not be allowed. Most people do not want to hear this. They want something added to what they have. They do not want to be told that they are permitting something that should not be allowed. In other words, they are doing what they should not be doing. But you ask, \"Is it true of Christians? Do you believe that many Christians are doing this?\" I have no hesitation in saying that all the symptoms in the church today point to Christians doing things they should not be doing and failing to do what they should be doing. That is the positive and the negative—sins of commission, sins of omission. To be unaware of these sins is to be morally asleep.',' 1 Corinthians 15:34','Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame.','Are we lulled to sleep by our own culture, our church culture? Insensitive to the Spirit\'s conviction and direction? Accommodating to church culture but closeting off areas of heart from the Spirit\'s control? We are His temple and He wants all of us.',' Lord, awaken me to the promptings of Your Spirit. Closets of heart I have blocked from Your control. Break them open and fully cleanse me. May I live in Your clear light.'),(326,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Three',' Awakened Out of Sleep','20',' Spiritual Sleepwalkers','When the Bible says, \"Awake to righteousness and sin not,\" it indicates the possiblity of a sudden awakening, like when an alarm clock going off rouses you out of sleep. There is such a thing as being asleep and suddenly being wakened, and this is surprising to people. People often say, \"You know, I was living a life displeasing to God. I was a church member, but though I didn\'t know it, I was displeasing to God. My life wasn\'t right. Then suddenly I was wakened by God. It was a surprise.\" . . . People who are awakened from moral sleep say, \"Well, what\'s the matter with me? I\'ve been living a life that\'s been displeasing to God, and I simply did not know it\". \"Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it. . . . This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven\" (Genesis 28:16-17). Jacob must have been rather disconcerted when he awoke and found that he had been in the presence of God all the time, but he had been asleep. He was not morally dead; he was not cut off from the covenant—he was merely asleep.',' Genesis 28:16,17','When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, \"Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it.\" He was afraid and said, \"How awesome is this place! . . . \"','We go through life thinking we are awake only to find we are not. We are sleepwalking—oblivious to the presence of God who is most assuredly there!','Lord, how can I be Your child and yet be so deaf to Your voice and so blind to Your presence? Wake me up for Christ\'s sake.'),(327,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Three',' Awakened Out of Sleep','21',' Responding to the Wake-Up Call','There is also spiritual sleep. Notice Ephesians 5:14: \"Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead.\" This verse is often spoken to sinners, but it was not written to sinners. Ephesians was never written to sinners. It is not a message to sinners at all, but a message to one of the best churches in the New Testament. Yet the writer says, \"Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.\" Some of the Ephesians were in a somnolent condition; that is, they were morally good but unenlightened. They were religious but unanointed. It is perfectly possible for a good, faithful, loyal church member to be spiritually asleep—being in a spiritual state that parallels natural sleep. When your husband, your wife, your child, your relative, your friend or you go to sleep tonight, the fact that you are unconscious and out of the running for a while is not bothering you. You know that normally you will wake up again. You are not dead, but you are cut off from your environment, all but that which is reflex—breathing and a few other things. Likewise it is possible to be a Christian, to be in the church and yet be asleep spiritually. Then you have to be wakened suddenly. You will probably be ashamed of yourself, angry with yourself, frustrated and disconcerted and say, \"What\'s the matter with me? All this time I was almost awake, but not quite.\"',' Isaiah 60:1','Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD rises upon you.','It\'s time to wake up. If we don\'t wake up now, it will soon be too late.',' O God, Your light has come. Your glory shines. Father, I want to get up today and live in that light.'),(328,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Three',' Awakened Out of Sleep','22',' Causes of a Dozing Church','What is the present condition of the evangelical church? The bulk of Christians are asleep. I do not mean that the bulk of Christians who come to evangelical churches are not converted, because if I meant that I would say they were dead and never had been born again. But I say they are asleep. It is possible to be morally asleep yet mentally, intellectually, physically and theologically alert. The present condition is that we are asleep. These sleeping Christians do two things that God must grieve over. One is that they control church affairs. We are democratic, and if we do not like a pastor we give him the bounce or pray that he will get another call. Then when the time comes we vote in whom we want and vote out whom we do not want. Church people control church affairs because they are intellectually, mentally and physically awake, but they may be morally and spiritually asleep. That is, they are so far down in the rut that they do not see up. Many people who are asleep control church affairs. It gets into whole conferences. Representatives will meet at the expense of the local church people. They will read minutes and pass resolutions, but they are asleep. You know they are asleep by the way they talk as soon as the benediction is pronounced and they have adjourned. You know they are asleep by their conduct, the things they are interested in or lack interest in, yet they control church affairs. The second thing sleeping Christians do is set the standards for new Christians. When you bring in a newly converted Christian, he or she automatically takes on the coloration, general mood and temperature of the solemn seats around him or her. Pretty soon he or she is where they are, and once again there are no good examples of the Christian life.',' Romans 13:11','And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.','Churches are not awakened unless people are. God\'s alarm has been going off for years. Are we listening? Let\'s wake up—you and me!',' Surely, Your coming is nearer than ever before. Lord, I want to be fully awake and to encourage others to be so as well. Wakened believers assure a wakened Church.'),(329,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Three',' Awakened Out of Sleep','23',' Wakeful Walking',' Of course, people resent any word reflecting on them, but every once in a while there appears an awakened soul. Some way or another this person got awake. Somehow God Almighty wakened him or her, whether by the crowing of the rooster or by the braying of Balaam\'s donkey. This person ceases to be mediocre and somnolent and becomes a blazing, shining light. And then the sleeping saints pay to have him or her come and do their work for them. They send people like this out to South Africa or the Far East to do their work for them. Meanwhile they stay home and sleep spiritually, and earn the money, because they are intellectually and physically awake to send them. When one of these people dies, they write the story of his or her life and may even go so far as to take up a collection to put up a little library in the person\'s memory. They could call it the \"Awakened Saint Memorial.\" But they are very careful not to be awakened themselves. They are careful and perfectly happy to talk about how wonderful Robert Jaffray was, but they will not pay Jaffray\'s price. They can talk endlessly about wonderful Dr. A. B. Simpson, but they will not go Simpson\'s way. They are careful not to follow the person whose life they write about and whose memorial they erect. But this is what Christianity is all about: the wakened soul, the morally and spiritually wakened. God, who seems so far away, suddenly becomes close. God, who had been all out of focus, a blur, now is seen to be the Son of Righteousness in clear sight, with healing in His wings.',' Malachi 4:2',' But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall.','Though benumbed by drowsiness, we can recognize those who are wide awake to the fullness of God. Rather than admiring them from afar we need to rise up and join them in full awareness of spiritual reality. God wants each of us to glory in Him and reflect . . .',' Thank You, Lord, for those so reflective of You that others are drawn to You. I, too, want to so know You.'),(330,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Four',' The Church in the Rut','24',' Betrayed by Time',' Churches get in ruts only because individuals get in ruts. It is impossible that the church should do anything that individuals do not do. It is impossible that we should make any progress except as made by individuals. It is impossible there should be any regress unless individual Christians go backward. Think about people who find themselves in religious ruts. They discover a number of things about themselves. They will find that they are getting older but not getting any holier. Time is their enemy, not their friend. The time they trusted and looked to is betraying them, for they often said to themselves, \"The passing of time will help me. I know some good old saints, so as I get older I\'ll get holier and better. Time will help me, purify me and revive me.\" They said that the year before last, but they were not helped any last year. Time betrayed them. They were not any better last year than they had been the year before. . . . I say to you that the people in the religious rut are getting older, but they are not getting any holier. Time, which they have trusted to be their friend, is betraying them and proving to be their enemy. Time is doing something else to them: it is increasing their indifference to spiritual things. The signal that God used to be able to get through to them easily is now getting fainter and fading away. Once in a while on good days they can still hear it.',' Luke 22:46','\"Why are you sleeping?\" He asked them. \"Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.\"',' The passing of time does not assure holiness. Rather, it contributes to spiritual lethargy. If we are going to grow we need to rise NOW, today, and walk with God.',' Lord, You lend me time that I may spend it well. Forgive me for squandering it. I want to use it for You.'),(331,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Four',' The Church in the Rut','25',' The Feasibility of Change',' . . . people in ruts . . . discover that the passing of time tends to dull their religious feelings, and the signal that used to be quite clear is fading out. Then they worry a little and say, \"The signal is gone. I\'ll have to do something.\" Suddenly it comes on again and they hear it a little and say, \"Oh, it\'s not so bad after all.\" They are just in a favorable pocket—perhaps some new preacher has come to town. They think they are hearing the voice again, and they are, a little bit. But it is not long until they are out of range and cannot hear it any more. Time has increased their indifference to spiritual things and dulled their religious feelings, continually making them harder to change. Change is one of the ingredients of Christianity. If people could not change, the gospel would be absolutely meaningless. If the Lord would say, \"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ; repent and believe,\" and a person could not repent or believe, the gospel would be meaningless. The fact that people can change is the only hope they have. If they could not change, there would be no reason to preach to them that they must change. And yet we are sent to preach that people should change, meaning they should repent. They should turn from darkness to light. They should turn from idols to God. They should change. This is absolutely necessary, a vital ingredient in the spiritual life.',' Ephesians 4:1','As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.','Thank God a man or woman can change! We don\'t have to be what we once were or even now are. We can change. It is God\'s provision in Christ that makes change not just possible but feasible.',' O God, thank You that I can change. Your provision and the presence of Your Spirit within me invite change.'),(332,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Four',' The Church in the Rut','26',' The Falling of Life-Leaves',' People who are in the rut, the circular grave, find that it is getting harder for them to change. They used to have spells when they were emotionally moved. Their wills got over on the side of God, and they really meant to make themselves into good Christians by the grace of God. But those times are getting fewer. They cannot afford to wait and say, \"Oh, well, I will do it next Thanksgiving. I\'ll do it when I come home from vacation.\" No, they will either do it now or they will not do it at all. There comes a time when they must make a change. If they do not make it, they never will. Time is stealing away their days of opportunity to make it. They began with a given number of days, and they have already used up so many days. But the tragedy is that they do not know how many remain. They do not know how many they have left because they do not know how many they had to start with. While they could count the number of days they have been on the earth, they do not know how that stacks up to the number accorded them, so they do not know where they are. They only know that the days are doing what the poet said about the leaves. \"The leaves of life keep falling one by one.\"',' Psalm 144:3,4',' O LORD, what is man that you care for him, the son of man that you think of him? Man is like a breath; his days are like a fleeting shadow.',' Our life-leaves are falling. Time ticks away. Let\'s change today, now! God cares. Let us care.',' Lord, I want to change. I want to grow in You. I want to be wholly Yours in all areas of life.'),(333,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Four',' The Church in the Rut','27',' Seeker, Pretender, or In-the-Rut Disciple',' . . . People in the rut never know when the last leaves are falling for them. Why are people in the rut? There are several possibilities. They may never have been truly converted at all, and this is one of our great problems now. We have a dozen ways of getting people into the kingdom of God, when the Lord said there was only one. They leak in, ooze in, come in by osmosis and get in by marriage—just get in by any kind of way. But there is only one true way. When people find that after being in the church for years they are not making much progress, they ought to examine themselves and wonder whether they have been truly converted. True conversion means radical repentance, a changed life, conscious forgiveness of sin and a spiritual rebirth. Genuinely converted people, as the old Methodists said, had a radical repentance, which eventuated in a changed life. Then there came a consciousness of forgiveness of sins and a spiritual rebirth. People in the rut may never have had that at all. . . . People in the circular grave, who are getting older without getting holier, may have been abandoned to the devil because of two things—some fleshly sins (1 Corinthians 5) or grave irreverence at the communion table (1 Corinthians 11). Protestants are altogether too much inclined to take things for granted. We laugh at those on the other side of the ecclesiastical fence because they bow and scrape and kowtow in the presence of the church. But we lack reverence—not because we are free in the gospel, but because God is absent, and we have no sense of His presence. We sometimes come to the communion table in a moral and spiritual state totally unfit for receiving communion, and yet we take it. Paul said, \"We are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.\"',' Matthew 7:21','Not everyone who says to me, \"Lord, Lord,\" will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.','It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the sincere seeker, the \"church member\" pretender and the in-the-rut disciple. But God surely knows and the Spirit will reveal to us our own personal state. Or do we already know?',' Lord, I want to do Your will. I want to get out of the rut and follow You. In Your name and power I rise up!'),(334,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Four',' The Church in the Rut','28',' Living that Grieves the Spirit','It is almost certain that sin is the cause of the rut, the circular grave in which so many people find themselves. Since only sin offends God, and sin is extremely deceitful, it can be present doing its deadly work while the people may not be aware of it at all until it is called to their attention. There are several kinds of sin that cause the rut. First is the sin of omission, an act left undone that should have been done. Next is the sin of commission, which is an act displeasing to God, to the Holy Spirit. There is also sin of the flesh. The world may approve of sin of the flesh, and even churches and pastors may permit it. It is astonishing what preachers will joke about with their congregations, laugh off and put up with. Maybe pastors permit it or laugh it off at least, and say, \"Oh well, you can\'t be too holy, too angelic in this world.\" But the Holy Spirit is grieved by it. So the people move around their circular grave not hearing the voice much any more. They used to hear it, \"Get up, get up. You\'ve been in this place long enough. Get up! Move! There\'s the land before you—I\'ve given it to you. It\'s all in the covenant; it is all in the purchase of the blood. It is all yours. Get up and move toward me. Move toward the holy place and the holy land and your possessions. Victory and deliverance and power in prayer—it is all yours. Rise up and take it.\" They once heard that signal coming strongly to them, but it is not coming so strongly any more. The Holy Spirit is grieved and does not talk so much. And the people move around in their circular grave.',' Ephesians 4:30','And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.','It is possible to grieve the Holy Spirit; to put out the Spirit\'s fire (1 Thessalonians 5:19). Does my daily life grieve Him? Quench His fire? Am I hurting Him and reducing His fire in me to barely smoldering ashes?','O Holy Spirit, forgive me for grieving You and quenching Your fire within. Let me hear Your voice again and rise up to live under Your control. In Jesus\' name.'),(335,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Four',' The Church in the Rut','29',' Cultivating Spiritual Disciplines','Perhaps they have committed sins of the mind. . . . To think God\'s thoughts requires much prayer. If you do not pray much, you are not thinking God\'s thoughts. If you do not read your Bible much and often and reverently, you are not thinking God\'s thoughts. Those thoughts you are having—and your head buzzes with them all day long and into the night—are earthly thoughts—thoughts of a fallen race. They are the thoughts of a lost society. They should not be our thoughts. Paul said, \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus \" (Philippians 2:5 KJV). There also has to be a lot of meditation. We ought to learn to live in our Bible. Get one with print big enough to read so it does not punish your eyes. Look around until you find a good one, and then learn to love it. Begin with the Gospel of John, then read the Psalms. Isaiah is another great book to help you and lift you. When you feel you want to do it, go on to Romans and Hebrews and some of the deeper theological books. But get into the Bible. Do not just read the little passages you like, but in the course of a year or two see that you read it through. Your thoughts will one day come up before God\'s judgment. We are responsible for our premeditative thoughts. They make our mind a temple where God can dwell with pleasure, or they make our mind a stable where Christ is angry, ties a rope and drives out the cattle. It is up to us. What should you then do? Examine yourself. Have you found yourself in that awful circular grave, not making any spiritual progress? Have you found that the passing of time upon which you have leaned so heavily has become a broken reed and is not helping you at all?',' Romans 12:2','Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God\'s will is—His good, pleasing and perfect will.','To be Christian we must think Christian. Transformation is by mind renewal. There are patterns of thought, attitudes, habits that the Spirit wants to replace with those compatible with the faith walk. What we think is crucial.','Cleanse my mind, O God. Help me to discipline my thinking so that I think on those things that are true, spiritually real, Christ-focused.'),(336,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Four',' The Church in the Rut','30',' Self-Examination','The philosopher Socrates said, \"An unexamined life is not worth living.\" If a common philosopher could think that, how much more we Christians ought to listen to the Holy Spirit when He says, \"Examine yourself.\" An unexamined Christian lies like an unattended garden. Let your garden go unattended for a few months, and you will not have roses and tomatoes but weeds. An unexamined Christian life is like an unkempt house. Lock your house up as tight as you will and leave it long enough, and when you come back you will not believe the dirt that got in from somewhere. An unexamined Christian life is like an untaught child. A child that is not taught will be a little savage. It takes examination, teaching, instruction, discipline, caring, tending, weeding and cultivating to keep the life right. I do not want to leave you on a low note. I am trying to wake you, not discourage you. There is not a reason in the world for you to be discouraged. . . .',' 2 Corinthians 13:5','Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?','It is good and necessary to examine our lives by the light of God\'s Word. It exposes our need but also illuminates the Great Provider.',' Lord, examination sends me running to You for cleansing, forgiveness and Your life. I want to walk in step with You.'),(337,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Four',' The Church in the Rut','31',' The Cure','. . . suppose that I found an old fellow sitting on a bench and I went and sat down beside him. I noticed by looking at him that he had high blood pressure. I could tell it by the veins that stood out on his forehead. I began to try to tell him, \"You have lived long enough on this bench. Get up; there\'s something better for you,\" and he began to resist me. Then I would have to preach a whole series of sermons to him to get him to know how sick he is, when just down the street a little way was the cure for what was wrong with him. That is precisely where we are in the church. You have to work on people for weeks to get them to see that they are in a rut. It would be cruel to do if there was not a remedy. But the justice of God is on the side of the confessing sinner. \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9). Because Jesus Christ died, because He was God and because He was man, His atonement was absolutely and fully efficacious. All of the attributes of God are on the side of the person who confesses his or her sin and turns and runs to the feet of Jesus. \"My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world\" (2:1-2). There is the elixir. There is the cure. That is only one little passage, and of course similar ones are all over the New Testament. The blood is shed for us. God pardons and forgives for Christ\'s sake. The Holy Spirit is here to take the things of Christ and make them real to us. There is nothing, not even the devil himself, that can hinder the confessing sinner.',' 1 John 2:1-2','My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.','We are familiar with the cure. Are we using it? Why do we crawl in dirt when me may grasp His hand, get up and walk in forgiveness and new life?',' You, Christ, are my Advocate, my Intercessor, my Lord. By faith I receive Your life.'),(338,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Five',' Getting Out of the Rut','32',' Working Out What God Works In You','The Holy Spirit in this passage is saying two things: God works in you to will, but you are to work with God in working it out. God works in you—that is, God is always previous. God is the aggressor. God saw you in the rut and wanted you to get out of it. He thought of it first, not you. The impulse to know God came from Him and not from you. God works first, and because God works we are to work with Him. We are therefore to dismiss all doubts and all morbid humility. It is entirely possible to be so humble, in a sick kind of way, that you paralyze yourself and get nowhere. For instance, you say to yourself, \"That man has been preaching about getting out of the religious rut. While I haven\'t agreed with everything, I have been feeling that I am in a rut and that I ought to get out. This circular grave is getting deeper every year of my life, and I can hardly see out of it. Give me four or five more years and you\'ll look right over me and not know I\'m here. I need help. But I wonder if God will help me.\" That is morbid humility. . . . The very fact that you want out is proof that God has been working in you to will to get out. And if God worked in you to want to get out, then when you ask Him to get you out, do you suppose He would not help you out? Would God put an impulse in your heart and then refuse to accept your prayer when you came in answer to that impulse? . . .',' Philippians 2:12-13','Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.','We are to continue to work out our salvation for it is God who energizes us to will and to act according to His good purpose. Those two roles are essential. The absence of either one keeps us in the rut.',' Amazing, Lord, You energize me to act according to Your purpose. Trusting You, I am going to do so.'),(339,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Five',' Getting Out of the Rut','33',' Faith That Acts in Faith','People use the word fanatic whenever you get a little bit joyful about the Lord. They say you are a fanatic. Webster says that a fanatic is somebody who is too enthusiastic about religion, as if you could be too enthusiastic about religion. John Wesley said, \"A fanatic is one who seeks desirable ends but ignores constituted means.\" Suppose a farmer boy with his blue jeans, torn shirt and tattered straw hat wants to get a fish. His mother says, \"Why don\"t you go down and catch a couple of trout, son.\" So he goes down by the creek. It is a beautiful day, the sun is shining and the cows are standing deep in the water under the shade trees. So the boy pulls off a stalk of grass and begins to nibble on it, and he starts wondering about those fish. He says to himself, \"I remember the pastor said if we want anything to pray for it.\" In the meantime the fish are breaking the surface begging to be caught. But there he is praying, \"Lord, send me some fish.\" He can pray until he dies and he will never have any fish. The Lord put intelligence in his head and gave him what we call constitited means. The farm boy takes a branch from a tree, ties on an ordinary piece of cord, puts a bent pin on the end and throws the hook with a worm on it into the streams. The fish will take it. Would it be proper for the farm boy to be pious and pray for fish or to throw in his hook and pull out fish? Everybody knows that if a farm boy addresses the Almighty God in a loud voice asking for fish when the fish are breaking the surface begging to be caught, something is wrong. He is a fanatic—he is trying to get a desirable end, but he is ignoring constituted means.',' Acts 14:9-10','He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed and called out, \"Stand up on your feet!\" At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.','Paul saw that the crippled man had faith to be healed. \"Stand up on your feet!\" At those words the man acted in faith. He jumped up and began to walk.',' Lord, I sometimes act without faith or by faith but not in You. But when I act believing You and Your Word, I can get up and walk. Thank You!'),(340,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Five',' Getting Out of the Rut',' Days #34',' Faith Despite Feeling or Sight',' A fanatic is somebody seeking desirable ends but ignoring constituted means. Seeking to get out of the religious rut is a desirable end. It is right and it is in the will of God. But trying to do it in a manner that is not according to God\'s constituted means is all wrong and gets us nowhere. When they want to get blessed, some people try getting worked up psychologically. There are some who, while they have not studied psychology, are master psychologists. They know how to manipulate audiences, knowing when to lower their voices and when to raise them, when to make them sound very sad and all the rest. They know how to get people all worked up. . . . Some people try group dynamics. We all sit around together and practice togetherness, and by practicing togetherness we finally work up some spirituality. What is needed is some old-fashioned, salty horse sense. I am sure there are 189 mules in the state of Missouri that have more sense than a lot of preachers who are trying to teach people how to get the blessing of God in some way other than by the constituted means. When you get people all broken up, dabbing at their eyes and shaking, what is the result? It does not bring them any closer to God. It does not make them love God any better, in accordance with the first commandment. Nor does it give any greater love for neighbors, which is the second commandment. It does not prepare them to live fruitfully on earth. It does not prepare them to die victoriously, and it does not guarantee that they will be with the Lord at last.',' 2 Corinthians 5:7',' We live by faith, not by sight.','Faith acts, resting on God\'s promise and power, whether there is accompanying emotional fervor, no emotion, or adverse emotion. We live by faith. There may be feeling and sight or there may not.',' O God, I am inclined to act by feeling rather than by faith. Help me to discern the difference. In Christ\'s name.'),(341,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Five',' Getting Out of the Rut','35',' Constituted Means: Irrevocable Commitment','The Lord has constituted means. Jesus said in the Gospel of John, \"Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me\" (John 14:21a). Anybody can understand that, ever the teacher of group dynamics. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and show myself to him. If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me (14:21b, 23-24). What our Lord taught was this: when we obey the words of Jesus, in faith and in love proving that we love Him, He shows Himself to us. There are two subjects acting here—we and He. When we obey His Word we prove that we love Him, and He shows Himself to us. Who is this He that I am talking about? Jesus Christ our Lord. There are, then, two divinely constituted means: faith—the right kind of faith, in our Lord Jesus Christ—and obedience to His Word. Jesus said, \"Ye believe in God, believe also in me\" (John 14:1 KJV). Faith in Jesus Christ, the right kind of faith, the only kind of faith that matters, is irrevocable, total commitment to the Person of Jesus Christ Himself. You cannot go back on it, and if it is total, there is nothing that is not included. Faith in Jesus is not gulping twice and saying, \"I accept Jesus.\" It is getting into a state where you have totally committed yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ. It is irrevocable commitment to the Person of Jesus Christ.',' John 14:23','Jesus replied, \"If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.\"','Loving Christ and obeying Him are inseparably linked. Obeying is faith in action. Obeying is love in expression, because what He asks is often beyond our full understanding. Nevertheless we follow in simple trust and commitment.',' Lord, my shaky, \"revoking\" commitment robs me of Your revelation to me along the way. Here\'s my heart, oh, take and seal it to unconditional commitment to You and Your Word.'),(342,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Five',' Getting Out of the Rut',' Days #36',' The Danger of Misplaced Commitment','Faith in Jesus is not commitment to your church or denomination. I believe in the local church; I am not a tabernacle man. I believe in the divine assembly. We ought to realize that we are, as a group of Christians, a divine assembly, a cell in the body of Christ, alive with His life. But not for one second would I try to create in you a faith that would lead you to commit yourself irrevocably to a local church or to your church leaders. You are not asked to follow your church leaders. You are not asked like a little robin on the nest to open your innocent little mouth and just take anything I put in. If what I put in is not biblical food, regurgitate and do not be afraid to do it. Call me or come see me or write me an anonymous letter. But do something about it. Do not, by any means, swallow what your leaders give you. Here is the book, the Bible; go to it. Faith is faith in Jesus Christ, God\'s Son. It is total faith in Christ and not in a denomination or church, though you may love the church and respect and love your leaders and your denomination. But your commitment is to Christ.',' 1 Corinthians 3:5','What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task.','God uses human leaders in leading us. But they can stumble and fall. Our faith commitment must be in Him. It is to Christ that we are ultimately responsible.',' It is You I want to follow, Lord, You. Help me to distinguish You and Your leading from the human leaders You use but who sometimes fall.'),(343,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Five',' Getting Out of the Rut','37',' Learning to Lean as He Leads','Obedience to Christ proves we love Him, and in return He shows Himself to us. You say, \"There are so many commandments, how can I obey? How can I remember them all, and can I be sure I am obeying?\" In faith and love, rest, wait and look. Then as His teaching touches your life, conform to it. There are some teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ that you would never get into because they would not touch you. They would not impinge on you in your present state. But as soon as they do touch you, then you automatically, sweetly and quietly obey. A man was giving testimony about being shipwrecked and praying, and about how the Lord delivered him. A dear old man of God went home, got on his knees and wept before the Lord. \"God,\" he said, \"You never saved me from shipwreck.\" And the Lord said, \"Son, have you ever been at sea?\" The man answered, \"No.\" Of course you cannot save from shipwreck a man who has never been offshore. There are things that do not touch you, but the moment they do, obey instantly. For instance, the Bible says, \"Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord\" (Ephesians 5:22). If you do not have any husband, why worry about that one? But if ever the words of our Lord Jesus Christ touch your life, instantly—because you are totally committed—gladly and quietly obey and do what you are told. He said that is your part, and His part is to manifest Himself to you and get you out of the rut.',' John 10:14','I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me.','There is a simplicity in just following the Lord day by day. He shows His will in increasing areas of life and, as we follow, radical change occurs.',' You lead, Great Shepherd. I can follow You in confidence. You lead. You feed. You enable. Thank You!'),(344,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Five',' Getting Out of the Rut','38',' Just Do It','The Lord said to become children. If we all became children, how beautiful that would be. You could walk up to a man and shake his hand without wondering, \"Do I know enough judo to handle him?\" He would not hurt you. Christians here are not going to hurt anybody, so just be perfectly candid. This is one passage you can practice no matter who you are or where you are. It touches you right now. \"I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.\" (Luke 12:8). This passage tells us we are to testify and witness boldly about our Lord Jesus. If some of you would begin to quietly witness where you work, you would find a change coming over you. \"Whoever has my commands and obeys them. . . [I will] show myself to him\" (John 14:21). You will get out of the rut when the Lord begins to manifest Himself to you. But you would rather go off somewhere and get down on your knees and pray. Now praying is right—I have taught and preached and practiced it since I was converted. But do not try to pray down something that the Lord is telling you to do. Do what you are told, and the Lord will be right with you. . . .',' James 4:17','Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn\'t do it, sins.','We sometimes use \"spiritual activity\" to avoid doing what we know God wants us to do. Sometimes by prayer we try to change God\'s mind. And all the time we are missing His best for us!',' Lord, I rise up to do what I have long known You want me to do. Trusting You, I am going to do it.'),(345,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Five',' Getting Out of the Rut','39',' Saying Goodbye to the Rut','Jesus gives the story of the man who was covetous and lost his soul. So do not be covetous—-be generous. Do not be stingy, but be free with your money. Do not be afraid—thank the Lord, trust Him and put fear away. These are examples of the constituted means of faith and obedience. We sing this and do not know we are singing it: \"Trust and obey, for there\'s no other way/ To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.\" We sing that, but we have sung it so long that we might as well sing Mother Goose rhymes, because we do not know what we are singing. Some of us are down in a spiritual rut, the old routine. Nothing has any taste to it. Some churches try to handle that by pandering to the situation, bringing in every kind of weird claptrap in order to get some of the poor half-dead people to get a little taste again. We have God. We have Christ. We have truth. We have a world needing help. We have the saints, and we have the power of prayer. We have the joy of obedience and we have the sweet wonder of His presence. We have the joy of Christian song. We have all this and we do not need garbage. We have God. All we have to do is trust in His Son Jesus Christ and obey the truth, and the Lord will manifest Himself, show Himself through the lattice.',' John 10:10','. . . I came so they can have real and eternal life, more and better life than they ever dreamed of (The Message).','Spiritual reality eludes us when we merely play Christian and dip our toes in the water from the shore. Let\'s jump into His fullness, holding nothing back. Then we will know Him and grow in Him.',' O God, forgive me for living like a spiritual pauper when You want me to have life to the full. I\'m going to follow You, in Christ\'s enablement.'),(346,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Six',' Dealing with Spiritual Problems','40',' Fanning the Flame',' . . . The old soldier, Paul, was about to retire; that is, the Lord was about to take him home. Before he went he wrote a letter to his young coworker, much younger than he, but a noble young man. Timothy was full of faith, having been reared in a family where the faith of God was strong. He had proven himself a hundred ways in working with the great man Paul. But even Timothy, though very busy and even because he was so busy, was in danger of settling into a rut. Otherwise Paul would not have said, \"Fan the flame.\" In the King James this is translated \"stir up the gift of God.\" In Scripture God never uses superfluous words. He never says to a person who is wide awake, \"Wake up!\" He never says to a person who is lying down, \"Lie down!\" He never says to someone standing, \"Get up!\" And He never says to a person who is already stirred up, \"Stir up!\" God never wastes His words, and He never makes any little speeches like a person called upon at the laying of a cornerstone. Nor was Paul wasting words or giving a little talk that would be good just about anywhere. \"Stir up the gift of God that is in thee\" (KJV). Timothy needed this, or it would not have been written. The evidence is that Timothy, even though a hard-working and faithful man, was in danger of getting into rut. Paul said, in effect, \"Don\'t be ashamed of the cross.\"',' 2 Timothy 1:6,8-9a','For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. . . . So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God. He has saved us and called us to a holy life.',' God gives spiritual gifts to all believers. We need to be aware of the gifts He has given. Your gift and mine sometimes must be rekindled or fanned into flame, otherwise it may just burn out through unuse or misuse.',' Father, show me how to fan into flame that gift You have given me that by its use You may be glorified.'),(347,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Six',' Dealing with Spiritual Problems','41',' Enduring Hardship',' It is possible to be beaten until you are numb. You can smile and praise the Lord and say, \"Jesus, I my cross have taken,\" for a while. But then you are slowly beaten until you are numb, and you get into a sort of a rut where you cannot fight back. Timothy had been with Paul a long time, and Paul had been in so much trouble so much of the time. Timothy was tagging along behind in the same trouble, and Paul had noticed a little temptation to be ashamed of the cross. Essentially, Paul was saying, \"Don\'t be ashamed of the cross. Don\'t shrink from the affliction of the gospel. God has not given us the spirit of fear.\" Then in Second Timothy 2:3, Paul said, \"Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.\" It is as though he might have detected in the young man a little temptation to recoil a bit from the hard life he was called into. Paul knew that Timothy was basically a sound man. He knew Timothy had been reared in a Christian home. He mentioned Timothy\'s grandmother, Lois, and his mother, Eunice. The grandmother and mother were both Christians, and good ones. Young Timothy had learned and become a Christian early in life. Paul knew that he was basically sound. But Paul was afraid that the pressure of things and the boredom of always being in the minority might put Timothy in danger of leveling off.',' 2 Timothy 2:3',' Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.',' Hardship hurts, especially if it appears to us that by going incognito as a believer we can avoid it. Are we good soldiers, poor ones or have we gone AWOL?',' Lord, You know how I shrink from hardship. Yet, by enduring it, I can grow as in no other way.'),(348,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Six',' Dealing with Spiritual Problems','42',' Winter Experiences',' There is such a thing as a renaissance, a personal revival. The best illustration is the coming of the springtime on the farm. The snow will lay all winter long, and in some places you don\"t see the ground until springtime. How utterly dead everything looks, but you know that life is still there. The trees are stark, but there is life in them. The roots in the ground are all quiet, but there is life down there. Just below the frost line are the worms, the bugs, the mice, the moles and the chipmunks. They are all there, and there is life down there. They are all waiting for something, listening for Mother Nature to say, \"Stir up the gift of God that is in thee.\" Then comes the spring; the snow goes, and the blotches and patches begin to appear. The bobwhites begin to whistle their happy but monotonous song on the sunny side of the hill. The cattle begin to kick up their heels and run about the fields. That is spring. Pretty soon all the snow is gone, calves are born and lambs are about, and we start all over. Thank God, it is all new. There is such a thing in the Christian life as going under for a winter. In other words, something happens to you, little by little, until you get snowed under and frozen over. There is life down there, covered up by the frost and ice. It may be hidden; it is there somewhere.',' Psalm 55:6','I said, \"Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest—\"','\"Lord, to my heart bring back the springtime. Take away the cold and dark of sin,\" wrote Kurt Kaiser. The sunshine of His presence melts the snow and the ice. We feel we are growing again.',' Lord, bring back the springtime into my life. Refresh, renew! For Jesus\' sake.'),(349,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Six',' Dealing with Spiritual Problems','43',' Springtime of the Heart',' It is possible for us to go through spiritual experiences that can rouse us, the spiritual equivalent of a springtime in the meadow. I have seen it happen, and I would like to see it happen today. . . We can have the spiritual equivalent of springtime in the meadow, but we have to enter in. The tree waits it out, and even the animals have to wait it out. But you and I, being made in the image of God and having wills of our own, can do something about it. We can appeal directly to our hearts. We do not need to lie like a field covered over with snow. We can stir ourselves up. We can run to meet the sun. We can create our own crisis, because the job is not for meadow and grass, but for our own hearts. These other things only illustrate spiritual springtime. We can stir ourselves up. We can bring out the sun, and we can bring on the springtime. How do we get this to happen? First it must come to the individual. I have no faith in anything that happens to a church that does not happen to the individual. If it does not affect the individual, numbers of individuals, if it is only a sort of social overtone that affects everybody momentarily, I have no faith in it at all.',' Psalm 51:10','Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.',' Wrote William Quayle: \"Christ is come and has changed my winter into laughing spring.\" He can change your winter, too!',' Father, like the lost son, I get up and come to You. I embrace the springtime.'),(350,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Six',' Dealing with Spiritual Problems','44',' Getting Honest With God',' Try what I call the pad and pencil method. This method is very simple and consists of getting on your knees with your Bible, a pad of paper and a pencil. Read the Bible and then write down what is wrong with you. The only way to remain spiritual is to keep after yourself. The pad and pencil method is good. Read, for example, the Sermon on the Mount. When the Holy Spirit says, \"You are that person,\" write it down. Read on. When the Holy Spirit says you are wrong here or there, write it down. Then set your Bible aside and go over your list before God in confession with the promise that you will never be caught doing those things again. Commune with your own heart, be still and question yourself like a doctor with your open Bible before you. You will find that this will bring sunshine to your life, and you will have springtime in your heart. When you get before God realizing that there has been a bit of snow on the ground and that the happy song of the birds is not heard in the land and that the sweet smell of the flowers is not within you, begin to question yourself before God with the open Bible. The symptoms you already know, but try to get at the causes. If you are evasive with God, then there will be no help. If you are evasive with yourself, if you rationalize your weaknesses, you will get no help.',' Psalm 139:23-24',' Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.',' Being honest with God can lead to shocking revelations on His part. But it is the only way back to the springtime.',' Search me, O God, and know my heart. Help me to forthrightly deal with what You reveal.'),(351,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Six',' Dealing with Spiritual Problems','45',' Lovingly Truthful',' Here are some questions I recommend you ask yourself. In quiet silence ask, \"Am I always truthful and honest? I claim to be a Christian, and I believe that the root of the matter is in me and the seed of God is in my heart. I believe I am the Lord\'s child, but I am not satisfied with the frozen-over rut. Lord, help me to be honest while I answer. Am I always truthful on the telephone? Am I always honest with my creditors, with my employers, with my employees and in all social contracts and contacts?\" Somebody may say, \"What\'s the difference?\" Dishonesty and shading of the truth are sins that grieve the Holy Spirit and bring on the winter. The winter of your discontent may be upon you, and like the life in a leafless tree, your life is buried within. You may have grieved the Holy Spirit by untruthfulness. One of the first things Christians have to do is become perfectly honest with God and perfectly truthful in everything they say.',' Ephesians 4:15',' Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.','To be lovingly truthful is an expression of the Spirit\'s control. At times we may be untruthful even so slightly. At times we may be brutally truthful but unlovingly so.',' O God, You have been so lovingly truthful to me. Make me an instrument of loving truthfulness.'),(352,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Six',' Dealing with Spiritual Problems','46',' Cleaning Out the Closets','Another question to put to yourself is, \"Do I have any habits I am ashamed to let anybody know I have? Have I any personal habits that I am ashamed of? Do I hide something when the pastor is coming? If everything were known in the church about how I lived, would I go back to church?\" You can dodge this, twist it around and answer evasively, but the snow will lie on your heart. If you answer God honestly and go to work to get rid of it and clean it up, springtime will come for you. Then ask yourself, \"Is my speech clean?\" One of the most shocking things in the church is the dirty-mouthed Christian who always walks on the borderline. There is no place for borderline stories that embarass some people, and there is nothing about sex or the human body that is funny if your mind is clean. There was once a gathering of officers, and George Washington was present in the room. One of the young officers began to think about a dirty story that he wanted to tell, and he got a smirk on his face. He looked around and said, \"I\'m thinking of a story. I guess there are no ladies present.\" Washington straightened up and said, \"No, young man, but there are gentlemen.\" The young officer shut his mouth and kept the dirty story inside his dirty head and heart. Anything you could not tell with Jesus present, do not tell. Anything you could not laugh at were Jesus present, do not laugh at.',' Matthew 15:18-19','But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man \"unclean.\" For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.','Strange things are sometime hidden in the closets of the heart—things that do not belong in one who is a temple of the Holy Spirit.',' Lord, I want to clean out all the closets of my heart.

Am I using my money to bless people? Am I using my money to help find the lost sheep? Am I using my money to help feed the hungry children?\" Here is yet another question: \"Do I gossip about people? Have I been a troublemaker?\" Some people are disease carriers who are not sick themselves. They carry some disease, but they are not ill—just carriers. There are some Christians who are carriers. They can say \"amen\" with the best, can can sing \"Nearer My God to Thee\" with the loudest, but they are not around very long until suspicions begin to enter the minds of Christians. They are troublemakers and trouble carriers. Then, \"Have I judged other Christians?\" Your present frozen condition may be a judgment of God, for as you judge others so you will be judged by God. Your present frozen condition may be that you have judged somebody else to be frozen, and the Lord allowed the thing to turn around on you. \"Am I heavenly minded or earthly minded? Where do my thoughts tend to stray when they are free to stray where they will? What do I brood over? Are my thoughts pure and charitable?\" If you can find out what you brood over, you will know what kind of a Christian you are and what kind of a heart you have. We always brood over things that we love, or that we hate if we are holding a grudge against somebody.',' Philippians 4:8','Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things.','To be Christian we must think Christian.

Yes, you are busy. So was the Lord Jesus. So was Martin Luther. Luther said, \"In the morning I have so much work to do that I am going to have to pray longer today.\" Are you faithful in prayer, and do you meditate on the Word? How much of Scripture have you read lately? Have you read it with meditation and tenderness? These are a few questions. You can answer them evasively and the snow lies there. Or you can answer them honestly and see the springtime come to your heart. Put yourself in the hands of the One who loves you infinitely. If you have failed Him, you will have to admit that there is a rut or snow on the meadow. Tell Him so—don\'t hide it. He will not turn His back in anger and say, \"You disappointed me and betrayed me.\" There is a balm in Gilead, plenty of it. The balm and healing in the blood of the Lamb will get you out of the rut.',' Ephesians 6:18','And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.','Prayer that is prayer is honest, straightforward communication with God. It is not a monologue, a complaint recital, an endless wish list. It is communing with God and listening to Him.',' Lord, teach me to pray, really pray.'),(355,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Seven',' Three Spiritual Laws','49',' The Law of Surrender','The Bible says that we are to present our bodies \"as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.\" Of course, if you give your body, you give everything it contains. That means giving yourself wholly to God, and the idea of giving yourself wholly to God contains three laws. The first law is the law of surrender. If you do not surrender, it will be totally impossible for the Lord to do anything for you. Surgeons have to have the surrender of their patients. If I went to a surgeon and insisted that I was going to tell him how to do the job and not only that but stay awake and resist him, the surgeon could not work. It would be impossible. Surgeons must put their patients to sleep so they cannot resist, so they are in a state of surrender. That is the law of surrender. A more beautiful and biblical description is the story of the potter and the clay, which illustrates the law of surrender further. The potter has soft, yielding clay, but if the clay does not surrender, the potter cannot do a thing with it. If there are burnt places, hard places or unsurrendered places in the clay, though the potter be a genius in making vessels, the artist still could not make anything useful and beautiful out of an unyielding blob of clay. It is possible for an object to be useful but not beautiful, like a garbage can. It is also entirely possible to be beautiful and not useful, like the lily. The lily has no utilitarian place in the world. It is possible to have a vessel that is useful without being beautiful. The old cream crocks in our spring house on the farm were useful all right. You could pour the milk in them, wait for the cream to rise and skim it off. They were not beautiful, but they were quite useful. Everybody has in their home beautiful little knickknacks. They are utterly useless, simply to be enjoyed for their beauty. But God wants His vessels to be both useful and beautiful. If God is going to make those kinds of vessels out of us, however, we are going to have to yield to the law of surrender. Give yourself to God as a living sacrifice and let Him have you—all of you.',' Isaiah 29:16','You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, \'He did not make me\'? Can the pot say of the potter, \'He knows nothing\'?','Give yourself as a living sacrifice. That means living day by day on the altar. Sacrificial animals were killed then offered. No getting off the altar. Are we living on the altar or off of it?',' Lord, here I am. I give myself to You. O God, help me to stay on the altar and not to slip off.'),(356,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Seven',' Three Spiritual Laws','50',' The Laws of Concentration and Fascination',' Then there is the law of concentration. The secret of every successful person is concentration. Take a musician, for example. Most musicians are mediocre because they do not have time to concentrate. They might have greater ability than they are ever able to bring out because other things take their time. But an excellent musician must study and practice five and six hours a day. They must give themselves to it completely and concentrate. . . . Musicians, athletes and scientists may do other things, but they have just one thing to which they are totally committed. Third, there is the law of fascination. This is a little harder to understand, but it is just as real. To be fascinated, according to the dictionary, is to be held spellbound by some irresistible charm. If something does not fascinate us, we can take it or leave it. It is like the various art exhibitions. I can take them or leave them. Some people think a lot of the exhibitions, and I will go if somebody invites me; but I am not fascinated by them. I am not drawn to them by a charm that I cannot break. But in the kingdom of God there is the law of fascination, the law of irresistible charm. Christians who do not know the law will never be anything but half-Christians all their lives. They will always be in the rut. The law of fascination as seen in the world is often a personal tragedy. Being fascinated by something evil, base or unworthy can be a terrible tragedy. . . . Our Lord turns it around and says, \"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened . . . Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls\" (Matthew 11:28-29). In effect He says, \"Come to me and be fascinated by me. Concentrate upon me, surrender to me and yield so completely to me that you can give all to me.\"',' Philippians 3:13-14',' Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.',' Paul concentrated, pressing on. He was fascinated by the heavenward goal in Christ Jesus. For many of us knowing Christ is a goal but not the primary one in life.',' Lord, knowing You is the primary goal of my life. Forgive me for becoming absorbed in secondary matters.'),(357,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Seven',' Three Spiritual Laws','51',' The Wonder of God','Moses took us back to the beginning of all that we see, all that we call the universe. He took us back before the stars and moon were, before space was and before time was, and said, \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\" (Genesis 1:1). So Moses said that the One who calls us to Himself has a right to do so because He antedates time, He transcends space, He fills His universe and He is God. . . . David, in Psalm 103, showed that this God is not only a God who makes mountains, hills, rivers and streams, who rides upon the wings of the clouds, but He loves His people. \"For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him\" (v. 11). \"But from everlasting to everlasting the Lord\'s love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children\'s children—with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts\" (vv. 17-18). David tried to impart the incommunicable, tried to tell what cannot be told of the wonder of God.',' Isaiah 28:29','All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom.','God is so great! Why does He bother with us? Because His love is no less great than His other attributes. Think of that today!',' How big, how wonderful, how great You are, O God. And You are loving, infinitely so. Thank You for being such a God.'),(358,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Seven',' Three Spiritual Laws','52',' Christ the Sacrifice Receiver',' In the New Testament, John tried to tell us about God. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\" (1:1). \"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth\" (1:14). John the Mystic tried to tell us how great God is. The Apostle Paul also gave us insight on who God is. . . . And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ\" (Colossians 2:15-17). Why am I giving you all these passages of Scripture? Because I want to tell you who it is who says, \"Present your bodies to me. Take your cross and follow me. Give yourself wholly to me. Surrender to me. Concentrate upon me and learn to be fascinated by me.\" He is the only One who can say it.',' Colossians 2:9-10',' For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.',' We give ourselves to the One who has given Himself. We are given fullness in Christ. Are we experiencing that fullness?',' Incomprehensible, Lord, that You would receive one like me. But You do! And to You I give myself.'),(359,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Seven',' Three Spiritual Laws','53',' God Exegesis',' There is only one Man whom we can trust to follow. That Man is Jesus Christ. Why is He different from any other person? Why do I refuse to follow other people, and yet follow this Man? Of no other person can it be said, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\" (John 1:1). \"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth\" (1:14). Of no other person from Adam to now can it be said, \"He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace\" (Isaiah 9:6). Of no one else can it be said that three days after He had gone into the grave He rose again. Of no other person can it be said that while they beheld Him,\" . . . he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. \'Men of Galilee,\' they said, \'why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven\'\" (Acts 1:9-11). . . . This is the King of glory, this Man; and this Man is the one who says, \"Give yourself to me. Surrender to me and concentrate upon me. Be caught in the spell of the irresistible charm.\"',' John 1:18',' No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father\'s side, has made him known.',' Christ is the revelation of the unknowable God. He is the \"exegesis\" of God. The God-Revealer.',' O Christ, You have made known what otherwise I could never know. I gaze upon You, the God-One.'),(360,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Seven',' Three Spiritual Laws','54',' Real Worship','If you do not have this fascination, it could be that you are but another Esau. What a tragedy to be born of the red clay and live and die and be buried in the red clay. Shakespeare said of Caesar, \"That though he be the emperor yet give nature time and nature will reduce him to a bit of clay that might be used to keep the wind away.\" The great Persian poet Omar Khayyam said, \"When you drink out of that vessel, drink reverently; it may be your grandfather\'s dust out of which it is made.\" What a tragedy to be born out of the red clay and live a secular, earthly life and then die and be buried out of sight in that same red clay. But if you feel the charm, the tug and the pull of God, you will know what the Holy Spirit meant when He said, \"I urge you, brothers, in view of God\'s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship\" (Romans 12:1). How do you get out of the religious rut? You get out of the rut by giving God your all, letting God have you completely. Concentrate your whole life on God and His Son Jesus Christ. Then seek to know the sweet fascination of loving God. You cannot stay asleep very long when the beauty of Jesus is before your eyes. Some have been asleep long enough. If you could only wake to the voice of your Beloved. If you could only be awakened and roused and hear Him speak, it would be sweeter than the voice of the mockingbird, sweeter than the sound of the harp. The voice of God\'s Son—that would get you out of the rut, and that would get you out of your sleep. Jesus Christ is God\'s music, God\'s poetry, God\'s art, God\'s beauty, God\'s all.',' Romans 12:1','Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God\'s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy, and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship.','Your money, your time, your abilities—lay them on the altar. But they have little meaning until you climb up on the altar yourself—giving yourself. Then live there—-on the altar. All else you give will then reflect a given heart.',' Lord, there is no meaning to giving unless I first give myself. Here I am. Please receive me.'),(361,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Eight',' Breaking the Status Quo','55',' Persistence in Going On',' Israel allowed themselves to settle down and became contented with circumstances that were all right, but which could and did break their spirit of adventure and cause them to accept the status quo as being final for them. Every once in a while through prophet, apostle or psalmist, God stretches out His hand and tries to arouse His people from their sleep. Somebody once said that man is made of dust and dust tends to settle. People tend to settle down and do the same things year in and year out, slowly going around in a circle. When this gets into religion, it is deadly and evil. The majority of Christians are asleep and in a spiritual rut. Sometimes Christians who realize they are in a rut put pressure on others to adopt their viewpoint. But even if truth does not convince and persuade a man or woman, nobody has the right to set up a psychological squeeze on someone else. If people yield under pressure, it shows that they are too weak to resist. If they are too weak to resist, and if they take a religious position because they are too weak to resist, they will also be too weak to persist. When we follow Christ there must be persistence. We must go on.',' Hebrews 6:1',' Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity . . .',' Let\'s go on! There is more to experience in Christ. There are promises to be fulfilled. There are opportunities to be seized. Let\'s keep walking by the Spirit. Let\'s persist in going on!',' Father, I want to go on. I want to grow, to mature as Your child. I know that is Your will for me. Change me by Your Spirit! In Jesus\' name.'),(362,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Eight',' Breaking the Status Quo','56',' God at Work or Just Me?','To apply pressure, a person projects himself or herself into the minds and consciences of people made in the image of God and forces them psychologically to do something they have no particular reason for wanting to do. They are not basically interested in it and have no satisfactory reason for doing it, but they are under pressure. If they do not have a reason for doing what they are going to do, they will not know why they are involved. Then when they get out they will not be sure that they were in, and so the whole process makes for weak, spineless religion. This violates the law of human nature, which dictates that all valid acts must arise from a natural urge or from a convinced mind. An example of a natural urge is when you are hungry. You may be very hungry, but your hunger does not have a high intellectual content in it. Nobody needs to stand up and say, \"Now, all you who are hungry raise your hands.\" You know you are hungry, and you just go out to eat. Hunger is a natural urge. Another legitimate reason for an act is a convinced mind. I am convinced that I ought to do something, and I do it because I have a conviction that it ought to be done. Those are the only two reasons for doing anything. If I force people under psychological pressure and steamroll them into doing something because they are too weak to resist, I have violated their nature. Our approach to getting people out of the rut, then, must not be to pressure them to do something they don\'t want to do. Instead, we must present the truth and let the Holy Spirit prompt them to want to escape.',' John 16:7-8','. . . Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment.','Can we trust the Holy Spirit to convict of sin, to reveal Christ, to open the minds of people to understand spiritual truth? If He doesn\'t do it, it doesn\'t get done despite all our efforts.',' Lord, my greatest offensive weapon is prayer—believing, trustful prayer. I want to be Your instrument but keep me from trying to do what only You can do.'),(363,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Eight',' Breaking the Status Quo','57',' Making the Most of Opportunities','It is imperative not only that we Christians get out of our rut but that we get out now. You know if you are in. If you are not getting any prayers answered, or if your prayers are so vague you are not sure but what any answer might have been an accident, you are in the rut. If you are living far from God, yet hoping you are saved, you are in the rut. If you are not progressing, if you are where you were months or years ago, if you have settled down and learned to live with yourself and adjusted to your present spiritual state, you are in the rut. There are some reasons why it is imperative that we as a church and as individuals get out, and get moving on our way to a better spiritual life. One is that you have not much time to do anything about it. Your own interest is going to flag before long. Change is absolutely imperative to getting out of the rut, but the older we get the less we feel the need to change. If people have an urge within their spirits based upon a belief and conviction that they ought to move—to begin to reassess their lives and adjust their living—then they ought to do it right now while they are thinking about it.',' Ephesians 5:15-16','Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.','Opportunities are God-given. They are present tense, to be utilized at once, otherwise they are lost.',' Father, thank You for Your patience with me. And thank You for the opportunity to change.'),(364,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Eight',' Breaking the Status Quo','58',' Preparing Now for Then','. . . the Lord may soon return. I realize there is a lot that we do not know about prophecy, but most Christians are looking for the second coming of the Lord. They expect Him to come. They do not know when He will come, and the ones who claim they do, do not. Nevertheless, He may come in your lifetime. He said that He would come back in an hour when we think not. It could be that this present decline in expectation may have an ominous significance. It can easily be said that this would be the time when fewer people are expecting the Lord. Thirty years ago everybody was expecting the Lord and talking about it. Now few are thinking and less are talking about it. If you press people, they will admit that they believe in the second coming of Christ, but they are not looking for it expectantly. The last thing that bears upon the imperativeness of doing something about our spiritual life now is that we have such a short time to prepare for such a long time. By that I mean we have now to prepare for then. We have an hour to prepare for eternity. To fail to prepare is an act of moral folly. For anyone to have a day given to prepare, it is an act of inexcusable folly to let anything hinder that preparation. If we find ourselves in a spiritual rut, nothing in the world should hinder us. Nothing in this world is worth it. If we believe in eternity, if we believe in God, if we believe in the eternal existence of the soul, then there is nothing important enough to cause us to commit such an act of moral folly.',' 1 Thessalonians 5:5-6','You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled.','What would you do today if you knew for certain that the Lord was coming two weeks from today? Then do it today!',' O God, You have given me today—opportunity to invest today with tomorrow in view. Thank You.'),(365,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Eight',' Breaking the Status Quo','59',' Being and Doing as God Enables','Failing to get ready in time for eternity, and failing to get ready now for the great then that lies out yonder, is a trap in plain sight. There is an odd saying in the Old Testament, \"How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds\" (Proverbs 1:17). When the man of God wrote that, he gave the birds a little credit. It would be silly for a bird watching me set the trap to conveniently fly down and get into it. Yet there are people doing that all the time. People who have to live for eternity fall into that trap set for them in plain sight. It is folly to put off to a tomorrow because you may never see the things that you should do now. It is an act of inexcusable folly to count on help that will never come. It is foolish to ignore God\'s help now offered us. Many are guilty of ignoring the help that is presently being extended to them, all the while waiting for help that will never come from others. There is not much that can be said in favor of lazy or careless Christians. God never told anyone to do anything that he or she could not do. Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed arm that hung at his side like a limp piece of flesh, \"Stretch out your hand\" (Matthew 12:13a). And the man, believing that Jesus was the Christ, stretched out his hand and was healed instantly. God has never asked anyone yet to do anything that He was not enabling the person to do.',' Philippians 4:13','I can do everything through him who gives me strength.','If He gives us strength we can do it. But what if He gives us strength and we don\'t use it? God\'s enablement unexercised—the story of many believers.',' O Lord, teach me the sufficiency of Your grace and strength as I live this day. In Christ\'s name.'),(366,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Nine',' The Voice of God Speaking','60',' The Heavy Responsibility of Sheep-Feeding','God\'s Word says that a faithful and wise steward gives the people their meat in due season. Some people preach the Bible all right, and you cannot deny that. But they go to the Bible as you would to a medical book to find out what you should prescribe. But instead of prescribing to suit each patient, they just prescribe for everybody at one time. When a preacher is not preaching to a given situation, it is like givng medicine to people indiscriminately. That approach is not particularly fitted for teaching the Word of God. Even though it may be faithful and true, without any regard to the current situation, it is like teaching the multiplication table. The New Testament epistles were written to specific conditions, as were the seven letters of Revelation. Particular situations developed, and then the man of God wrote to these particular people. The seven letters found in Revelation were to particular churches, having regard to the needs of those churches. It was the same with the prophets of the Old Testament. No prophet went into an ivory tower, settled down to relax, read deeply awhile, took out a pen and said, \"Now, I\'m going to write a book of prophecy.\" They did not do it that way. They wrote to the need, to the situation. They aimed their arrows at a target. When God is speaking to a particular situation the power of the Holy Spirit is present and active. When David sinned, Nathan the prophet came to him and told a little parable. When David gave his judgment of what to do with the sinful man, Nathan pointed his finger at the king and said, \"You are the man\" (2 Samuel 12:7a). Immediately David threw off his crown and his robe, dropped his scepter, fell on his knees and repented before God. That was a particular situation. When we are talking to a specific situation the sheep are separated from the goats, the veil is removed and the judgment begins.',' Matthew 24:45','Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?','Are we praying for our pastor/shepherd that he will clearly discern God\'s will as to what food to feed us from the Word of God? He himself needs to eat and digest it and then prepare it for us in palatable form, exegetically sound. It won\'t all be our fa',' Lord, what a heavy responsibility to feed Your people—solid food for the mature as well as milk for the new believers. Father, enable those who feed us!'),(367,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Nine',' The Voice of God Speaking','61',' Hearing the Voice of God',' . . . There are two questions before us. The first question is: How many of us are willing to hear the voice of God? Jesus said, \"Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate\" (Matthew 23:34, 37-38). Were these people willing to hear the voice of God? Thousands of years before Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Holy Spirit said, \"Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares; at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes her speech: \'How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you. But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand, since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke, I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you\'\" (Proverbs 1:20-26).',' 1 Samuel 3:10',' The LORD came and stood there, calling as at the other times, \"Samuel! Samuel!\" Then Samuel said, \"Speak, for your servant is listening.\"',' We all delight in hearing God\'s voice in words of forgiveness and comfort. But are we willing to hear His voice in unvarnished truth and naked honesty? \"Speak, for your servant is listening\" or are we?',' Lord, there seem to be a thousand voices calling to me in this world. Help me to discern Your voice above them all and obediently listen!'),(368,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Nine',' The Voice of God Speaking','62',' Obeying God','The second question is: How many are worthy to hear His voice? In Acts 13:46b Paul and Barnabas told the people, \"Since you reject it . . . we now turn to the Gentiles.\" This is a terrible judgment. But here is the gist of what I want to say: A radical and sweeping reformation is imperative among the people called Christians—Protestants generally and evangelicals in particular. What is meant by reformation? Some may recoil from that word; I have heard people say, \"I do not believe in reformation—I believe in regeneration.\" That sounds good and it gets some amens, but the fact is, if you do not have reformation you cannot have regeneration. The Holy Spirit will not come and regenerate carnal, stubborn people who will not obey Him. First there must be a reformation. \"Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong, learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. \'Come now, let us reason together,\' says the LORD. \'Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool\'\" (Isaiah 1:16-18).',' Isaiah 1:18','\"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.\"','A heart committed to obey more quickly and clearly perceives God\'s voice. Sometimes we only want to hear what we want to hear.',' Father, sometimes the cost of obeying You seems so great, so painful. But what infinite cost is not obeying You.'),(369,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Nine',' The Voice of God Speaking','63',' Grappling with Change',' We need sweeping reformation. Let me give a definition of reformation as it is given in a religious dictionary: \"Change by removal of faults or abuses, and a restoration to a former good estate.\" Now that is not so bad. I do not know how anybody who believes he or she is a Christian could ever object to changing in the direction of the removal of faults and abuses toward the restoration to a former good estate. The problem is change, which disturbs many people. They have accepted the status quo as being the very tablets given by God on the mountain. Most people, if they happen to be in any church anywhere, accept the status quo without knowing or caring to inquire how it came to be. In other words, they do not ask, \"Oh God, is this of You, is this divine, is this out of the Bible?\" Because it was done and is being done, and because a lot of people are doing it, they assume it is all right. Then songs are written about it, and it gets into magazines. Pretty soon people are called to it, and the first thing we know we have gotten into a religious situation that is not of God. It is not according to Scripture, and God is not pleased with it at all. Rather, He is angry. Yet we do not know it because we do not like the word change. The change took place slowly, before we arrived on the scene, and we think because it is everywhere it is therefore right. We accept the status quo, the existing state of affairs, and say, \"This is it,\" forgetting that history demonstrates that religions invariably degenerate.',' Matthew 18:3','And he said: \"I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little chirldren, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\"',' Change by reversion to the past seems safe except that a return to external forms does not insure recapture of the inner reality. Nor does the invention of new forms assure heart change.',' Fascination with the new contemporary; nostalgia for the forms of the past; neither guarantee encounter with You. It is You I need, O God, You!'),(370,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Nine',' The Voice of God Speaking','64',' \"Religion\" Deterioration',' This is hard for people to face up to. Religion deteriorates just as fruit rots and just as people get old in spite of all they try to do at the drug stores. It is inevitable that we get old, and so it is with religion. It is built-in that we start to deteriorate shortly after God comes and blesses us. Look what happened to Israel. God called Israel out of Egypt, and it began to deteriorate before it reached the Red Sea. Then He gave it a revival by taking it through the Red Sea and into the wilderness. But Israel started to degenerate before it had gone 20 miles in the wilderness. As a result the people eventually wandered for 40 years. You can follow the history of Israel and see the story of the kings. It is a depressing story. Here is a man. He lived and did evil in the sight of the Lord. He had a son, and his son did evil in the sight of the Lord as his father before him. The status quo was maintained.',' Acts 7:51',' You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!','History demonstrates that each generation needs its own dramatic encounter with God, its great awakening. And each of us personally needs it. Spiritual life is not inherited from our forebears. It is experienced through personal encounter with God!',' O Spirit, I want to be filled with You, not to resist You.'),(371,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Nine',' The Voice of God Speaking','65','Decisions or Disciples?','Today we need people who dare to question the status quo and say, \"Wait a minute here. Where do you find this in the Bible?\" The idea that all you have to do is to accept Christ and you are in is a great mistake. It leaves people with the impression that if they accept Christ they have no fight to fight, no warfare, no job to do and no temptations. They are just in. When you accept Christ rightly as your Lord and Savior you are in, but to be honest, you have just started to fight. People get converted and we do not tell them that they must fight all the way through to heaven because of the spirit of degeneration and the tendency to deteriorate. They must fight, pray through, suffer it out and live in praise and worship, because if they do not they will deteriorate. Read the history of the Christian church if you can keep your faith and keep from weeping.','Acts 17:11','Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.','Winning people to Christ is one thing and extremely important. Discipling them is another: teaching them God\'s Word and how to study it for themselves and apply it to themselves. Have we neglected to disciple?','O Lord, thank You for those whom You have used to disciple me by word and especially by example.'),(372,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Nine',' The Voice of God Speaking','66',' Model Christians',' Then there is the removal of faults and abuses. Where are the faults and abuses? Look around at the religious scene and you will see the faults, the abuses and the desperate need for change. Where are the model saints? We ought to be raising model saints, the kind Christians could take as examples and say, \"I want to follow these men and women and be like them as they are like their Lord.\" But we are simply not producing saints in this generation. Most Christians are bad examples to other Christians. We work hard to get people converted, and we think we do God\'s service. Then after we get them converted and they get to know us, we are bad examples to them. I consider this an abuse in the church of Christ. . . . Another fault is carnality. The Apostle Paul talked about the carnal Christians of Corinth, and he labored and prayed and wept over the carnality of those Christians. This describes most evangelicals today: carnal, immature, without miracles, without wonders, lacking a wonderful sense of the presence of the Lord, held together by social activities and nothing else. Another roadblock to reformation is prayerlessness among God\'s people. For 100 years the Moravians never stopped praying. They staffed a prayer tower as a factory staffs its machines. In eight-hour shifts the Moravians continued their prayer vigil for 100 years. Carelessness is another fault among evangelicals. Careless Christians do not discipline or examine themselves. Plato once said, \"A life that is not examined is a kind of death.\" People who simply live by their instincts and do the best they can, but do not examine themselves are careless and, according to Plato, may as well be dead.',' Philippians 4:9','Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice...','Who among us would be so bold as to invite others to follow our example as did Paul? But we are modeling—negatively or positively—whether we intend to or not.','O God, make me a discipling instrument to walk beside other believers—teaching them to study Your Word and modeling the living of it. Only by Your enablement can I do it!'),(373,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Ten',' An Unchanging Book in an Ever-changing World','67',' Beliefs Nominal and Real',' One area of thinking that needs reform is our practical beliefs about God\'s design for mankind. I emphasize practical beliefs, because there is a difference between nominal beliefs and practical ones. A nominal belief is what you hold in name, and the practical belief is what you hold in reality and what holds you. While probably there are not many faults to be found with the nominal beliefs, there are a great deal to be found with the practical beliefs. These practical beliefs need restoration to their happy and bright state with faults and abuses purged. It has been a long time since Jesus was born in Bethlehem, died on the cross, rose again the third day, ascended to the right hand of God the Father Almighty and sent the Holy Spirit to establish His church. Since those days there have been changes in the world so radical, sweeping, all-pervading and revolutionary as to be entirely incredible to anybody living in Jesus\' day. Today\'s world was entirely unimaginable to the people of those times. Have these changes forced God to modify His plans for His church and for mankind? Here is where we have fallen by the wayside. . . .',' James 2:18b',' . . . Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.',' Our daily living expresses our real beliefs, not the beliefs or theology we say are ours but that which determines our daily living.',' Lord, I invite You to examine my belief system.

May Christians say, without a question, \"Yes, that is true.\" Actually, I suppose they would not like to have it put to them like that: People do not like the most realistic constructions. What would the liberals and modernists say if you backed them in a corner with the question, \"Do you think God has been forced to change His mind?\" I do not think anybody would quite have the courage to say yes. Nevertheless, they do say it little by little until they have brainwashed their people. In effect, they say that the Bible must be interpreted in the light of new developments. A book that was written in the day when people rode donkeys must be reinterpreted to mesh with contemporary society. They say that the prophets and apostles mistook what God intended to do. The Bible is outmoded and largely irrelevant. Irrelevant means that it is not related to anything. Outmoded means we have new modes of thinking and living now, so the Bible is out-of-date—a back-issue magazine. We must, therefore, reassess its teachings and rethink our beliefs and hopes. I am not overstating this at all. This is what is being taught today. It gets into the newspapers, and people are saying that the Bible must be interpreted in the light of all these changes. The apostles and prophets were mistaken. They had ideas that were good and advanced for their day, but not advanced for our day. We know more about ourselves, human motivation and the nature of things than they did back then. Therefore a book written when people thought the earth was flat and the sun rose in the morning, crossed over the earth and went down into the sea cannot possibly be taken seriously. While it certainly contains some beautiful poetry and some marvelously inspiring thoughts about human nature and the world in which we live, nevertheless all this is to be understood and reinterpreted, reassessed and rethought.',' Isaiah 40:8',' The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever.',' Each generation in its peculiar context must understand God\'s universal truth, translate it into their particular situation and live it out.',' Lord, open my mind to understand Your self-disclosure, to distinguish eternal truth from its particular context and to apply that truth to my own context in order that I may grasp Your truth and digest it.

Nevertheless, I challenge the idea that we are any further advanced than they were in the days of Jesus. If we are so advanced, then I want to ask some questions. Why do we kill thousands of human beings each year with automobiles? Because we ride automobiles instead of donkeys, we are advanced? If we are so advanced in our day, why are the penitentiaries packed full and the mental hospitals crowded? If we are so advanced, why is the whole world a powder keg? If we are so advanced, how is it that we have weapons that can annihilate the world? If we are so advanced, why is it that people cannot walk alone in the parks anymore? Why is it that workers who get out at midnight never walk home alone anymore? Why is it in this advanced age that drugs, violence, abortion and divorce are soaring? There is a mind-set that thinks every motion is progress. Every time you move you are progressing. Then there is the mind-set that thinks whenever you move in a straight line you are going forward, forgetting that you can move in a straight line and be going backward. The tragedy of the century is that Protestants have accepted this as progress and actually believe it. ...',' Hebrews 6:1a',' Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity . . .',' Has humanness changed over the centuries?

They accept the belief that there has been change and that Christians must adjust to the change. The word used is adjustment. We must get adjusted, forgetting that the world has always been blessed by the people who were not adjusted. The poor people who get adjusted cannot do much anyhow. They are not worth having around. In every field of human endeavor progress has been made by those who stood up and said, \"I will not adjust to the world.\" The classical composers, poets and architects were people who would not adjust. Today society insists that if you do not adjust you will get a complex. If you do not get adjusted, you will have to go to a psychiatrist. Jesus was among the most maladjusted people in His generation. He never pretended to adjust to the world. He came to die for the world and to call the world to Himself, and the adjustment had to be on the other side.',' Hebrews 11:16','Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.',' Those spiritual heroes of Hebrews 11 never became adjusted to the here and now.

Are we going to allow ourselves to accept the doctrine that the prophets and apostles were mistaken about God? Are we going to allow society to tell us that the Bible is outmoded and largely irrelevant and must therefore be reassessed in the light of modern advancements? Has God changed? Are we going to accept it? Is there a change in the purpose of God? Have the changes in human society startled or shocked God? Must we, in order to remain intellectually respectable and have good standing with these who doubt the Word, humbly say, \"Well, I do not believe in miracles\"? Or have we got enough of our Protestant protest and courage to stand up and say, \"I believe in miracles whenever God Almighty wants to perform them. I believe that whenever God wants to do anything that is out of the ordinary and contrary to or at least above the common processes of nature, He is able to do it. I believe the miracles of Jesus Christ were real miracles. I believe the miracles of the Old Testament were real miracles.\" Are we going to allow ourselves to be brainwashed along with all the rest? Or are we going to dare to stand and protest and be known over the country as being Protestant indeed? We would be people who refuse to adjust but who make the world adjust to us. When you adjust, you are dead. The same is true if a church adjusts to these ideas. If you adjust, you are done. But if you dare to stand, the world will adjust to you. I can promise you that. Not all will adjust to you, but at least some will.',' Hebrews 13:8',' Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.',' God has not changed but we mortals sometimes try to change Him.

We are not going to be sheep running over the precipice because other dumb sheep are running over it. We see the precipice—we know it is there. We are listening to the voice of the shepherd, not the voice of terrified sheep. The terrified, intimidated sheep are going everywhere. I stand solidly and protest this. I believe we need a reformation back to the belief that God knew what He was talking about in the first place. We need to get back to the belief that Jesus Christ did not miss anything but foresaw it all, back to the belief that the apostles spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. We must return to the belief that our fathers who gave us the great creeds were not fools but wise saints who knew what they were talking about.

He prayed and groaned in spirit and cried to God for people of all nations who had not heard the gospel. He prayed, \"Oh God, I believe Jesus Christ thy Son is the same yesterday, today and forever.\" We are his descendants, but we ought to spend a day in sackcloth and ashes. At 36, Simpson was a Presbyterian preacher so sick that he said, \"I feel I could fall into the grave when I have a funeral.\" He could not preach for months at a time because of his sickness.

A parasite would get into a little branch, pierce the bark and exude a gum. Then the branch would get a knot on it and bend. All over the trees were those little bent places with gummy knots. After two or three years, those cherry trees would not bloom. If they did, the blooms usually dropped early and the cherries did not come to fruition. If the blooms did not drop early, the cherries would be flat and undeveloped or only red on one side. My father was not too interested in fruit. He was interested in cattle, horses and grain. If my father had known how he could have protected those trees before they got into that wretched condition and properly sprayed or treated them, he could have gotten rid of the worms and bugs and saved the trees and fruit. I believe that a pastor who is content with a vineyard that is not at its best is not a good husbandman. It is my prayer that we may be a healthy and fruitful vineyard and that we may be an honor to the Well Beloved, Jesus Christ the Lord, that He might go before the Father and say, \"These are mine for whom I pray, and they have heard the Word and have believed on Me.\" I pray that we might fit into the high priestly prayer of John 17, that we would be a church after Christ\'s own heart so that in us He might see the travail of His soul and be satisfied. In order for us to be a vine like that, there must be basic purity. Each one must have a great purity of heart.

I also long in the tender mercies of Christ that among us there may be the following: 1. A beautiful simplicity. I am wary of the artificialness and complexities of religion. I would like to see simplicity. Our Lord Jesus was one of the simplest men who ever lived. You could not involve Him in anything formal. He said what He had to say as beautifully and as naturally as a bird sings on the bough in the morning. That is what I would like to see restored to the churches. The opposite of that is artificiality and complexity. 2. A radiant Christian love. I want to see a restoration of a radiant Christian love so it will be impossible to find anyone who will speak unkindly or uncharitably about another or to another. This is carefully thought out and carefully prayed through. The devil would have a spasm. He would be so chagrined that he would sulk in his self-made hell for years. There should be a group of Christians with radiant love in this last worn-out dying period of the Christian dispensation, a people so loving that you could not get them to speak unkindly and you could not get them to speak uncharitably.','1 Corintians 13:6&#150;8a','Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

A feeling of humble reverence. I am disapointed that we come to church without a sense of God or a feeling of humble reverence. There are false religions, strange religious cults and Christian cults that think they have God in a box someplace, and when they approach that box they feel a sense of awe. Of course, you and I want to be saved from all paganism and false cultism. But we would also like to see a company of people who were so sure that God was with them, not in a box or in a biscuit, but in their midst. They would know that Jesus Christ was truly among them to a point that they would have a sense of humble reverence when they gathered together. 4. An air of joyous informality. The great English preacher who was pastor for many years of Westminster Chapel in London, G. Campbell Morgan, left his church and went down to Wales where the Welsh revival was going on under Evan Roberts earlier in this century. He stayed there awhile and soaked up the glory of it. I read the sermon that he preached to his congregation afterward, and it was as near to scolding as that great preacher ever got. He said to them, \"Your singing is joyless, your demeanor is joyless, and you do not have the lift or joy that I saw in Wales.\" He urged them that they might get into a place where that sense of joyous informality might be upon them. 5. A place where each esteems others better than himself or herself. As a result of that, everyone should be willing to serve, but nobody would be jockeying for position. Nothing is quite so bitterly humorous as ambition in the church of Christ. It would be as though a man who was on a lifeboat being saved from certain salty death in the ocean depths should become ambitious to become captain of the little boat on its way to save those on board. It is as though a man were to enter a disaster area where an earthquake had hit and people were dying and would fight for a high position there. The church of Christ is no place for the ambitious or the lazy. . . .','Ephesians 4:2','Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.','Politeness is sometimes mistaken for reverence, irreverence for informality and \"Uriah Heep-ness\" for humility.

If you do not want it told, do not tell the little ones because they just tell anything. They do not have anything to hide. I believe that with the limitations proper to our adult years we ought to be a place where spiritually we should be so candid there would be no duplicity, no dishonesty. A duplex is a house where there is more than one dwelling; there are two dwellings. Duplicity is the same thing—it means two. Judas Iscariot, for instance, was duplicity incarnated. He was so slick that even the disciples did not know which one was the traitor. They said, \"Lord, is it I?\" And Jesus said, \"There\'s the man. When he dips into the dish you\'ll know him.\" He had to tell them. This son of perdition had lived with Jesus and His 11 disciples for three years and had fooled them so completely that they did not know which one was the traitor when the showdown came. They had to have a little sign to indicate. That was the slickest piece of duplicity I know about. He was two-faced, and he could change faces with the occasion. He was so slick in the change that nobody caught on. He showed one face to Jesus and His disciples and the other to the enemies of Jesus. Now that is duplicity. In Christian communion we ought to be a people without duplicity. Each one of us has only one face. I know that if you have more than one face to present to the public, something is desperately wrong. One of your faces is going to fall under an awful judgment of God. We must be without duplicity, dishonesty and hypocrisy. What is hypocrisy? Hypocrisy is an old Greek word used for an actor on stage, somebody who pretended to be what he or she was not. . . .

But one beautiful whiff of the fragrance of these garments and we will never be satisfied with anything less. When my wife and I were first married we attended a church of The Christian and Missionary Alliance in Akron, Ohio. There was something on that church, a sense of the fragrance of God.

You cannot get miracles as you would get a chemical reaction. You cannot get a miracle as you get a wonderful act on stage by a magician. God does not sell Himself into the hands of religious magicians. I do not believe in that kind of miracles. I believe in the kind of miracles that God gives to His people who live so close to Him that answers to prayer are common and these miracles are not uncommon. John Wesley never lowered himself to preach miracles once in his life. But the miracles that followed John Wesley\'s ministry were unbelievable.

Many Christians today will not endure sound doctrine. Paul described these people as having \"itching ears\" (2 Timothy 4:3). They did not like sound doctrine, but they were Christians. They called themselves Christians, but their ears were itchy. A commentator I read some years back explained this. In Paul\'s day the pigs had a disease called \"itching ears.\" The symptom was that their ears got inflamed and itched terribly. The only way they could get relief from these inflamed ears was to go to a pile of rocks and rub their ears earnestly and vigorously. The stones scratched their ears for the time being. Paul saw that, smiled a sad smile and said, \"I am running into Christians here and there who are just like that. They love pleasure more than God and will not endure sound doctrine. They have itching ears so they will be eager for something else beside the sound doctrine and holy ways. They will pile up teachers everywhere and rub their ears for dear life.\" That is a most dramatic and colorful illustration. A lot of so-called Christians have to have piles of rocks to rub their ears. They will not endure sound doctrine. I think that is a description of the churches, Protestant and evangelical.

Their attitude toward Protestantism generally is that of a matter of course, and people, even average Christians, think they are in favor of the church. They favor the church much the same as they support motherhood, decency and sanitation. It is as accepted as a convention that we never question or doubt. If anybody does question or doubt, they are considered communists or atheists. People will even pour out their money to support social convention. But I wonder how many ever sit down and say, \"What is this? Maybe the church is just something that is here; it doesn\'t have any value and doesn\'t have any reason for being here.\" How many present-day Christians have ever searched the Scripture with a serious burden on their hearts to know what the church is? Is it simply a convention that is carried on? How many Christians have ever prayed earnestly for light from heaven about it? It seems that the average person spends more time and intellectual labor each year filling out income tax forms than he or she spends in a lifetime trying to learn from the Scriptures and from the light of the Spirit what the church is and what he or she ought to do about it. Why is it in the world? What did Jesus mean when He said, \"On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it\" (Matthew 16:18b)? If people were to chew their pencils and walk the floor and go out for a walk and come back and work on it and search and think and discern and divide and go through all that they have to go through to make out their income taxes every year, I believe that they could come up with some wonderful answers.',' Ephesians 1:22-23',' And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.',' What is the Church? \"Church\" as part of the name on the outdoor sign or as a social institution with a plethora of activities may be only a part or may not be the Church at all. What is the Church in biblical perspective?',' Lord, as I study Your Word the Church emerges as something so close to Your heart, so vital to Your purpose, so enabled by Your Spirit. No wonder Satan seeks to distort my understanding.'),(390,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Twelve',' A Biblical Concept of the Church','84','Church Universal','When we know what the universal church is, we will understand what a local church is. The average local church is to a large extent a social organization where well-intentioned people get together and know each other. They are drawn together by coffee, tea, friendship, skating parties and things like that. Those things are harmless. But when we know what the church really is, we will understand that while these things are all right on the margin of the church, they are not the purpose of it. Meeting, shaking hands and drinking coffee are perfectly legitimate if we do not need them—they are not what holds us together. But when those activities are what hold us together, we do not have a church; we have something else. Unfortunately, we might as well admit it: That is often all that the churches have.','Romans 12:4-6a','Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. . . .','To be a part of the Church of Christ extended around the world — those who have been spiritually born through Christ — is an expression of the one Church. Every national and local church is authentically Church though worshiping in different languages and cultur','Lord, when I think of Your universal Church—my brothers and sisters in far away places, I am humbled. Many of that extended family serve You at great personal cost. May I faithfully serve!'),(391,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Twelve',' A Biblical Concept of the Church','85',' Church as the Bride of Christ',' . . . the church is the bride of Christ. Jesus was a complete man. He had all the nature of a man, but He never married. He could have, but He never did. He never married any woman though He was a true and complete man. He never married a daughter of a woman that He might marry His whole church, the bride. A true local church is the bride of Christ in recapitulation, in miniature. Everything that is in the whole church of Christ should be recapitulated in the local church. The church, part of it in heaven and part of it on earth, is the bride of Christ. Our Lord Jesus washed His bride, regenerated her and prepared her. He is coming back to take her—the whole church—as His bride. But any local church is the whole church in recapitulation, just as a local election recapitulates a national one. The same liberty is expressed. The same candidates run. They talk about each other; they plead their own worth and put up bulletins and do the same thing on a small scale that they do on the federal level. That may be a poor illustration, but the whole bride of Christ is recapitulated. Any local church is what the whole church is, just in miniature  \"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church\" (Ephesians 5:25-29). This figure drawn from husbands and wives is applied directly without apology to Jesus Christ and His church. Just as a young man would not marry a dirty bride, so Jesus Christ will not marry a church that has stains or wrinkles or blemishes. His desire is for a glorious church, and He wants to love that church as a man loves his own bride.',' Ephesians 5:25-27','Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.','What sacrificial love has Christ demonstrated for His Church! And we are His Church. He feeds us and cares for us. Even our small and weak local group of believers is part of His Church!',' Only You, O Christ, can make Your Church holy and blameless! Thank You for Your redeeming love so deep and wide.'),(392,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Twelve',' A Biblical Concept of the Church','86',' Church as the Body of Christ','If you are a member of the true church of Christ, then you are a member of the company that will make up the true bride of Christ. As a local church, we are a miniature of the bride of Christ. A second description of the church is the body of Christ. Jesus Christ is the head, and as the head of His church He directs it. My hands move because my head tells them to. My head directs my body. The head of a local church is not the pastor, but Jesus Christ the Lord. He is the head of the universal church of which the local church is a part. A local church is not all the body of Christ, but in miniature it is the body of Christ.',' Ephesians 4:4-5','There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to one hope when you were called—one Lord, one faith, one baptism.','Church as the body of Christ is a uniquely Pauline image. Christ is the head. Believers are body members with special body functions. As members of the same body we are interrelated and interdependent. No one of us can exist as a loner cut off from others.',' Lord, thank You for the many other body members through whom You have ministered to me. And thank You for the privilege of being part of Your body through whom You minister to others.'),(393,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Twelve',' A Biblical Concept of the Church','87',' The Ark Analogy','Third, the church is depicted as an ark on the flood waters. As the ark of Noah floated on the waters and contained all who would be salvaged, so the church of Jesus Christ is an ark on the flood waters and contains all who will be salvaged. Remember that! All in the ark are saved, and all outside the ark perish. All around us is a perishing world, and we float on top of it in a little ark called the church. All that are not in the church—the ark—will perish. You say, \"Now hold on a minute. Do you mean to say that if you don\'t join the Avenue Road Church, you will be lost?\" No, but what I do say is that the church is the ark containing the ransomed, and inside the ark is life. Outside the living church of Christ are the lost. Inside are the saved. You are not saved by joining a church, which is a mistake local churches make. The animals all came into Noah\'s ark by the door. Christ is the door to the church, and whoever will be saved must come in by the door. There is no other ark on the flood. Suppose someone said, \"Well, hold on a minute. Don\'t be so narrow-minded. Let\'s be tolerant. We do not want to get in Noah\'s ark; we want an ark of our own.\" Well, there weren\'t any other arks on the flood. It was either get into Noah\'s ark or perish. A few got into Noah\'s ark, and God preserved the race. In the church of Christ, God is salvaging a small number from the flood. A fatal error is the independent life—to say that you are a Christian, but you don\'t associate with any churches. You are a Christian, but you don\'t feel the necessity to join a church. It is true that there are hypocrites in the church—not in the true church, but in the local assembly. Even Jesus had His Judas. The local assembly and the true church of Christ are sometimes not synonymous.',' 2 Peter 2:5,9','If [God] did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; ...if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment.',' While the ark is not used as an explicit image of the Church, a number of references are found in the New Testament suggesting a typological analogy. The Church is the only ark in the flood of judgment and Christ is the only way to get on board.',' How good, Lord, to be part of Your Church in the turbulent world sea. \'In a love which cannot cease, I am His and He is mine.\''),(394,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Twelve',' A Biblical Concept of the Church','88','Membership in the Universal Church','Sometimes people come into the local church who have never come into the universal church. People join a church who have never been born into the true church. Some churches actually throw the doors open and say, \"Now we\'ll sing the closing hymn for those who want to unite with the church. Come to the front.\" Al Capone could come in and join. Nobody asks any questions; they just take in anybody. I do not believe in that at all, and I know you do not either. I believe that if you are going to get into a local church, you should first be in the universal church, which Jesus purchased with His own blood. You should get into the church with rebirth, the Holy Spirit and regeneration. Then you should join a local assembly. It is impossible to receive Christ and reject His people. How do you find the Shepherd? Go where the sheep are! If you do not know where the Shepherd is, then go where the sheep are. All else being equal, that is where you will find the Shepherd. Whoever receives Christ must receive His people too. Jesus said, \"He who receives you receives me\" (Matthew 10:40a). Whoever rejects the bride rejects the Bridegroom, and whoever rejects the flock rejects the Shepherd. I think that is clear enough.','Acts 9:31','Then the church [singular noun] throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord.','One does not enter the Church through the front door of a building, the \"New Comers Class\" or an interview with elders. It is by being born of God through faith in Christ. Then comes identification with a local group of fellow believers who form a local','Lord, thank You for local believers with whom I can worship, through whom I can be ministered to and with whom I can be part of Your Church in my community.'),(395,'Rut, Rot or Revival',' Twelve',' A Biblical Concept of the Church','89',' Believing Heart and Confessing Mouth','If you want fellowship with the church, if you have not formally joined, there are two ways to do so. One is to pray in public, give money, show enthusiasm and fill out a card. The other is to do first things first—join the universal church—and then also fill out a card. An important part of joining the church is public confession. Why does the Lord want us to make a public confession? The Bible says,  \"The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: That if you confess with your mouth, \'Jesus is Lord,\' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved\" (Romans 10:8b-10).  The heart believes and the mouth confesses. Both are necessary to salvation. Even the thief on the cross made his poor pitiful confession. That is why God wants us to fellowship with each other, get together and tell the world and tell each other—because with the mouth confession is made for salvation. My plea is for those who have never undergone the marvel of the regeneration of new birth to take this seriously. Remember you get into the ark through the door, and Jesus Christ is the door. If you reject the ark, you reject the door, and if you reject the door you perish in the flood.',' Romans 10:10',' For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.',' We are members of Christ\'s body the Church. Through us, you and me, Christ wants to reach out to others through our living and our mouths.',' O Lord, open my mouth to confess You boldly to people I meet. In my heart I believe but with my mouth I am slow to speak of You to those who do not know You.'),(396,'Rut, Rot or Revival','12',' A Biblical Concept of the Church','90',' Boldly Christ\'s',' To become a member of the body of Christ and join with the bride of Christ, you must be born into the family of Christ. It happens by believing in your heart that Jesus is Lord and confessing your faith with your mouth to the people. This is reasonable, and I do not understand why anybody should find fault with it. Suppose you were somewhere in the world, and someone asked you your nationality. Is there anybody here that would be ashamed to say where you were from? Why then should you go through life being secret Christians, too frightened, too scared to say, \"I am a Christian\"? If Jesus Christ has honored you by finding you and laying His hand on you, you ought never be ashamed of Him. You should be able to stand anywhere at any time and say, \"I do not care who knows it. I am a Christian.\" Be proud. I want the world to know that I am a Christian. From reading the lives of the saints I know I have a long way to go, and I want you to know that, too! I have a sharp tongue and an abrupt manner, and sometimes I say things that hurt feelings. I do not want to hurt your feelings. Just forgive a fellow who is too dumb to know better. I may not be a good Christian, but I am still a Christian. I am a member of the body of Christ. I am in the ark along with the blessed few who have been honored by God with grace, and for that reason I am not ashamed and I do not want you to be. We want a separated-from-the-world, heads-up, knees-bent, living church! Sure we can have our skating parties, gatherings and coffees. Nothing is wrong with that, provided we know that we do not need it. These activities are something on the side so we can relax. Jesus Christ is our center, and so the way to get in is by faith and confession.',' Acts 4:31',' After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.',' Why is it we try to be Christians incognito in certain situations? He is our Lord and He is not ashamed to call us His own.','Father, I am shy and timid by nature but will You give me boldness? May I be Peter after Pentecost, not Peter in the high priest\'s courtyard!'),(397,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' One',' The Next Chapter after the Last','1',' The Last Chapter','The four Gospels tell the story of the life and ministry of Jesus, and in so doing, they follow accurately the ordinary course of biography, giving the facts of His birth, growth, work, death and burial. That is the way with biography: the very word itself suggests it, for it comes from bios, life, and graphein, to write, and means the written history of a person\'s life. So says Noah Webster. Now, when we look at the Gospels we note an odd—and wonderful—thing. An extra chapter is added. Why? Biography, by its own definition, must confine itself to the record of the life of an individual. That part of the book which deals with the family tree is not biography, but history, and that part which follows the record of the subject\'s death is not biography either. It may be appraisal, or eulogy, or criticism, but not biography, for the reason that the \"bios\" is gone: the subject is dead. The part that tells of his death is properly the last chapter. The only place in world literature where this order is broken is in the four Gospels. They record the story of the man Jesus from birth to death, and end like every other book of biography has ended since the art of writing was invented. . . . They all agree: Jesus was dead. The life about which they had been writing was gone. The biography was ended. Then, for the only time in this history of human thought, a biographer adds to his book a new section which is authentic biography and begins to write a chapter to follow the last chapter. . . .',' 1 Corinthians 15:17-18',' And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.',' If Christ had not risen from that tomb of death our faith and that of millions of believers over the centuries would be utterly futile.

There was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, . . . There laid they Jesus.\" They all agree: Jesus was dead. The life about which they had been writing was gone, The biography was ended. Then for the only time in this history of human thought, a biographer adds to his book a new section which is authentic biography and begins to write a chapter to follow the last chapter. This time the story did not end with a funeral. The Subject, whose story should have ended at death, was once again back among men to challenge new writers to try to find enough paper and enough ink to write the rest of the story of the life that can never end. Whatever is written of Him now is written of a living man. He was dead, but He is alive forevermore.',' Romans 6:4',' We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.','What if Christ had not risen? That demonstration of His post-resurrection power would be absent. Those promises of His unfulfilled—the coming of the Holy Spirit, the presence of Christ with us, His intercession for us, His coming again.',' Forgive me, Lord, for failure to live in the experience of Your resurrection power.

That such a thing could be was intimated by the miracles of restoration which our Lord performed during His earthly ministry. The widow\'s son was brought back to life for a brief time; at our Lord\'s gentle call Jairus\'s little daughter rose from her bed of death; and Lazarus, at Christ\'s command, came forth bound hand and foot. These were but vague disclosures of what was to come, and were at best only temporary suspensions of the inexorable law which demands that death shall always follow life—death complete and final. For these all died again, and the rule of biography was upheld. Each ended in a sepulcher at last. And that sepulcher was the period at the end of the last chapter. What a perpetual wonder it is, then, that the biography of Jesus had to be resumed. Luke added not merely another chapter, but a whole book. The book of Acts was a logical necessity. \"He showed himself alive after his passion,\" writes Luke. The rest of the New Testament gives us some idea of what He is doing now, and prophecy reveals a little of what He will be doing through the ages to come.','John 11:44','The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\"','What was it like for Lazarus to be dead four days and then be raised to life again? Did he want to return?

Amen!'),(400,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' One',' The Next Chapter after the Last','4','The Unending Chapter','That next chapter after the last is the source of all the Christian\'s hope, for it assures us that our Lord has put death in its place and has delivered us from the ancient curse. Death did not end the activities of our Lord; it did not even interrupt them, for while His body lay in Joseph\'s new tomb, He was preaching to the spirits in prison (1 Peter 3:18-20). And after three days, His spirit was reunited with His body and the new chapter began, the chapter which can have no ending. Had Christ not risen from the dead, His life, beautiful as it was, would have been a human tragedy. Since He did in fact rise, His life has been shown to be an unrelieved triumph. The blood, the pain, the rejection, the agony of dying, the cold, stiff body and the colder tomb—these belong to the former days. The days that are now are days of hope and life and everlasting freedom. What is true of Christ is true also of all who believe in Him. How many saints since New Testament times have lived and hoped and labored and worshiped, only to grow old and bent and to drop at last, weak and helpless, into the open grave. If that was for them the end, then we Christians would be of all men most miserable. But it was not the end. For all of God\'s true children there will be another chapter, a chapter that will begin with the resurrection and go on as long as eternity endures.','1 Corinthians 15:20','But Christ indeed has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen alseep.','Relatively little is revealed in Scripture concerning the believer\'s life in heaven. Are we not able to grasp what it will be like? We have little or nothing in human experience that qualifies as an accurate simile.','My only hope for life in that unending chapter is You, O Christ. You are the firstfruits. We are those that follow!'),(401,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Two',' Quality versus Quantity','5','The Psychology of Impermanence','Time may show that one of the greatest weaknesses in our modern civilization has been the acceptance of quantity rather than quality as the goal after which to strive. This is particularly evident in the United States. Costly buildings are constantly being erected with no expectation that they shall last more than one short generation. . . . Not only in our architecture but almost everywhere else is this psychology of impermanence found. A beauty salon ad recently defined a term which has long needed clarification. It read: \"Permanent Waves. Guaranteed to last three months.\" So, permanence is the quality of lasting three months! These may be extreme cases, but they illustrate the transiency of men\'s hopes and the brevity of their dreams apart from God. The church also is suffering from a left-handed acceptance of this philosophy of impermanence. Christianity is resting under the blight of degraded values. And it all stems from a too-eager desire to impress, to gain fleeting attention, to appear well in comparison with some world-beater who happens for the time to have the ear or the eye of the public. This is so foreign to the Scriptures that we wonder how Bible-loving Christians can be deceived by it. The Word of God ignores size and quantity and lays all its stress upon quality. Christ, more than any other man, was followed by the crowds, yet after giving them such help as they were able to receive, He quietly turned from them and deposited His enduring truths in the breasts of His chosen 12. He refused a quick shortcut to the throne and chose instead the long painful way of the cross. He rejected the offers of the multitude and rested His success upon those eternal qualities which He was able to plant in the hearts of a modest number of redeemed men. The ages have thanked God that He did.','Acts 9:31','Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord.','Quantity growth of the church is noted at least nine times in Acts 2-9. Occasionally specific numbers are given. But quality is not sacrificed for quantity. Spirit-filled witnesses, healings, and miracles characterize the growing, first-century church.','Lord, give discernment to our church leaders so that they are deceived neither by growth in numbers nor desperate clinging to decline and methods of the past. May their eyes be focused on the primary goal of Spirit-filled living.'),(402,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Two',' Quality versus Quantity','6',' The Contemporary vs. the Eternal',' Pastors and churches in our hectic times are harassed by the temptation to seek size at any cost and to secure by inflation what they cannot gain by legitimate growth. The mixed multitude cries for quantity and will not forgive a minister who insists upon solid values and permanence. Many a man of God is being subjected to cruel pressure by the ill-taught members of his flock who scorn his slow methods and demand quick results and a popular following regardless of quality. These children play in the marketplaces and cannot overlook the affront we do them by our refusal to dance when they whistle or to weep when they out of caprice pipe a sad tune. They are greedy for thrills, and since they dare no longer seek them in the theater, they demand to have them brought into the church. We who follow Christ are men and women of eternity. We must put no confidence in the passing scenes of the disappearing world. We must resist every attempt of Satan to palm off upon us the values that belong to mortality. Nothing less than forever is long enough for us. We view with amused sadness the frenetic scramble of the world to gain a brief moment in the sun. \"The book of the month,\" for instance, has a strange sound to one who has dwelt with God and taken his values from the Ancient of Days. \"The man of the year\" cannot impress those men and women who are making their plans for that long eternity when days and years have passed away and time is no more.',' Psalm 119:105',' Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.',' Contemporary and Eternal. Are they compatible? The challenge is to recognize and communicate the eternal without contemporary or traditional forms letting in syncretistic or current worldview error.',' Father, Your Word is my light along the way. It keeps me from detouring into the momentary popular or the hoary traditional. Increase my sensitivity to perceive Your light. In Jesus\' name.'),(403,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Two',' Quality versus Quantity','7','Growing Oaks or Ears of Popcorn','The church must claim again her ancient dowry of everlastingness. She must begin again to deal with ages and millenniums rather than with days and years. She must not count numbers but test foundations. She must work for permanence rather than for appearance. Her children must seek those enduring things that have been touched with immortality. The shallow brook of popular religion chatters on its nervous way and thinks the ocean too quiet and dull because it lies deep in its mighty bed and is unaffected by the latest shower. Faith in one of its aspects moves mountains; in another it gives patience to see the promises afar off and to wait quietly for their fulfillment. Insistence upon an immediate answer to every request of the soul is an evidence of religious infantilism. It takes God longer to grow an oak than to grow an ear of popcorn. It will cost something to walk slow in the parade of the ages while excited men of time rush about confusing motion with progress. But it will pay in the long run—and the true Christian is not much interested in anything short of that.','Genesis 15:6','Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.','Abraham believed God and kept on believing God. He waited 25 years for the birth of Isaac. In his lifetime, Abraham never saw the emergence of the people Israel or experienced possession of the Promised Land. He just believed and kept on believing.','Father, You are everlasting. You are forever. Help me to trustfully walk with You through the valleys and over the mountains. I want to be an oak.'),(404,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Three',' We Must Stay by the Majors','8',' Concentrating on Things that Really Matter',' In the Christian life also we find this pattern repeated: a few important things and a world of burdensome but unimportant ones. The Spirit-taught Christian must look past the multiplicity of incidental things and find the few that really matter. And let it be repeated for our encouragement, they are few in number and surprisingly easy to identify. The Scriptures make perfectly clear what they are: the fact of God, the Person and work of Christ, faith and obedience, hope and love. These along with a few more constitute the essence of the truth which we must know and love. Christ summed up the moral law as love to God and man. Salvation He made to rest upon faith in God and in the One whom He had sent. Paul simplified the wonders of the spiritual life in the words, \"Christ in you, the hope of glory.\" The temptation to forget the few spiritual essentials and to go wandering off after unimportant things is very strong, especially to Christians of a certain curious type of mind. Such persons find the great majors of the faith of our fathers altogether too tame for them. Their souls loathe that light bread; their appetites crave the gamy tang of fresh-killed meat. They take great pride in their reputation as being mighty hunters before the Lord, and any time we look out we may see them returning from the chase with some new mystery hanging limply over their shoulder. Usually the game they bring down is something on which there is a biblical closed season. Some vague hint in the Scriptures, some obscure verse about which the translators disagree, some marginal note for which there is not much scholarly authority: these are their favorite meat. They are especially skillful at propounding notions which have never been a part of the Christian heritage of truth. Their enthusiasm mounts with the uncertainty of their position, and their dogmatism grows firmer in proportion to the mystery which surrounds their subject.',' 2 Timothy 3:7',' ...always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.',' Seizing upon minor issues and becoming engrossed in details can be an excuse for failure to live the unmistakable truth.',' O God, You are the Light. The closer I come to You the more clearly the dark holes of my heart are exposed. Shine on me and burn away the dross. For Christ\'s sake.'),(405,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Three',' We Must Stay by the Majors','9',' Heart Health Food or Just Tasty Snacks',' Dr. Samuel Johnson, the famous English sage, once said that one of the surest evidences of intellectual immaturity is the desire to startle people. Yet there are Christians who have been fed upon the odd, the strange and the curious so long and so exclusively that they have become wholly unfitted spiritually to receive or to appreciate sound doctrine. They live to be startled by something new or thrilled by something wonderful. They will believe anything so long as it is just a little away from the time-honored beliefs of sober Christian men. A serious discourse calling for repentance, humbleness of mind and holiness of life is impatiently dismissed as old-fashioned, dull and lacking in \"audience appeal.\" Yet these things are just the ones that rank highest on the list of things we need to hear, and by them we shall all be judged in that great day of Christ. A church fed on excitement is no New Testament church at all. The desire for surface stimulation is a sure mark of the fallen nature, the very thing Christ died to deliver us from. A curious crowd of baptized worldlings waiting each Sunday for the quasi-religious needle to give them a lift bears no relation whatsoever to a true assembly of Christian believers. And that its members protest their undying faith in the Bible does not change things any. \"Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\"',' Acts 2:42-43',' They devoted themselves to the apostles\' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.',' Is the \"apostles\' teaching\" still at the heart of our worship services or do we feature the more interesting story-telling and Christian entertainment? Perhaps it is the Spirit\'s power demonstrated in some wonders and miraculous signs we need.',' Lord, give me a hunger for the solid food that feeds the heart and a holy dissatisfaction with anything less.'),(406,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Three',' We Must Stay by the Majors','10','Staying with the Clear Teaching of Scripture','Every believer as well as every minister of Christ must decide whether he will put his emphasis upon the majors or the minors. He must decide whether he will stay by the sober truths which constitute the beating heart of the Scriptures or turn his attention to those marginal doctrines which always bring division and which, at their best, could not help us much on our way to the Celestial City. No man has any moral right to propound any teaching about which there is not full agreement among Bible Christians until he has made himself familiar with church history and with the development of Christian doctrine through the centuries. The historic approach is best. After we have discovered what holy men believed, what great reformers and saints taught, what the purest souls and mightiest workers held to be important for holy living and dying—then we are in a fair position to appraise our own teaching. Humility is the only state of mind in which to approach the Scriptures. The Spirit will teach the humble soul those things that make for his salvation and for a holy walk and fruitful service here below. And little else matters.','1 Corinthians 4:6','Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, \"Do not go beyond what is written.\" Then you will not take pride in one man over against another.','There is the danger of embellishing the written, even ranging beyond it, in order to serve up the new, the exotic, the innovative. Oh, for preachers who open to us the meat of God&rsquo;s Word with contextual accuracy, clarity, sound exegesis, and meaningful application.','Thank You for access to Your Word, Lord. There are many in the world without the Word in their language. May I receive it and live it to Your glory. Amen.'),(407,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Four',' Complaining: A Disease of the Soul','11',' The Illogic of Complaining',' Among those sins most exquisitely fitted to injure the soul and destroy the testimony, few can equal the sin of complaining. Yet the habit is so widespread that we hardly notice it among us. The complaining heart never lacks for occasion. It can always find reason enough to be unhappy. The object of its censure may be almost anything: the weather, the church, the difficulties of the way, other Christians or even God Himself. A complaining Christian puts himself in a position morally untenable. The simple logic of his professed discipleship is against him with an unanswerable argument. Its reasoning runs like this: First, he is a Christian because he chose to be. There are no conscripts in the army of God. He is, therefore, in the awkward position of complaining against the very conditions he brought himself into by his own free choice. Secondly, he can quit any time he desires. No Christian wears a chain on his leg. Yet he still continues on, grumbling as he goes, and for such conduct he has no defense.',' Philippians 2:14-15',' Do everything without complaining or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation.',' The cause for complaint is often a God-given opportunity for growth and praise. What at first appear to be thorns may prove to be divine prods that move us closer to God.',' Deliver me from complaining, Lord. Rather, teach me to praise You and thank You for the opportunities to grow.'),(408,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Four',' Complaining: A Disease of the Soul','12','Costs of Complaining','The complainer is further embarrassed by the moral company in which he finds himself. His is a spiritual affinity with some pretty shady characters: Cain, Korah, the sulky elder brother, the petulant Jews of the Book of Malachi who answered every fatherly admonition of God with an ill-humored \"Wherefore have we? Wherein have we?\" These are but a few faces that stand out in the picture of the disgruntled followers of the religious way. And the complaining Christian, if he but looks closely, will see his own face peering out at him from the background. Lastly, the believer who complains against the difficulties of the way proves that he has never felt or known the sorrows which broke over the head of Christ when He was here among men. After one look at Gethsemane or Calvary, the Christian can never again believe that his own path is a hard one. We dare not compare our trifling pains with the sublime passion endured for our salvation. Any comparison would itself be the supreme argument against our complaints, for what sorrow is like unto His? After saying all this we are yet sure that no one can be reasoned out of the habit of complaining. That habit is more than a habit—it is a disease of the soul, and as such, it will never yield to mere logic. The only cure is cleansing in the blood of the Lamb.','Numbers 16:1-2','Korah son of Izhar, the sons of Kohath, . . . and certain Reubenites . . . became insolent and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.','Korah and members of the council challenged Moses&rsquo; leadership. They experienced God&rsquo;s judgment as a result. Are there churches experiencing God&rsquo;s judgment because of grumbling and complaint against God-appointed leaders? ','Lord, I find it far easier to grumble and complain against leaders than to graciously submit to them. May I faithfully pray for my leaders.'),(409,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Five',' The Duty of Opposing','13',' Daring to Stand for Truth','The nearer we draw to the heart of God the less taste we will have for controversy. The peace we know in God\'s bosom is so sweet that it is but natural that we want to keep it unbroken to enjoy as fully and as long as possible. The Spirit-filled Christian is never a good fighter. He is at too many disadvantages. The enemy is always better at invective than he will allow himself to be. The devil has all the picturesque epithets, and his followers have no conscience about using them. The Christian is always more at home blessing than he is opposing. He is, moreover, much thinner-skinned than his adversaries. He shrinks from an angry countenance and draws back from bitter words. They are symbols of a world he has long ago forsaken for the quiet of the kingdom of God where love and good will prevail. All this is in his favor, for it marks him out as a man in whom there is no hate and who earnestly desires to live at peace with all men. In spite of his sincere longing for peace, however, there will be times when he dare not allow himself to enjoy it. There are times when it is a sin to be at peace. There are circumstances when there is nothing to do but to stand up and vigorously oppose. To wink at iniquity for the sake of peace is not a proof of superior spirituality; it is rather a sign of a reprehensible timidity which dare not oppose sin for fear of the consequences. For it will cost us heavily to stand for the right when the wrong is in the majority, which is 100 percent of the time.',' 2 Thessalonians 2:15',' So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.','It is easier to excuse ourselves from religious conflict than to assert the truth in a Spirit-emboldened manner. But there are times when we are God\'s strategically-placed person. We speak and live as His representatives.',' Lord, You know that my inclination is to flee from controversy and confrontation. O Lord, show me when to confront and enable me to do it for Christ\'s sake.'),(410,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Five',' The Duty of Opposing','14','Standing for Truth','We have developed in recent times a peace-loving, soft-spoken, tame and harmless brand of Christian of whom the world has no fear and for whom it has little respect. We are careful, for instance, never to speak in public against any of the false cults lest we be thought intolerant. We fear to talk against the destructive sins of modern civilization for fear someone will brand us as bigoted and narrow. Little by little we have been forced off the hard earth into a religious cloud-land where we are permitted to wing our harmless way around, like swallows at sundown, saying nothing that might stir the ire of the sons of this world. That Neo-Christianity, which seems for the time to be the most popular (and is certainly the most aggressive), is very careful not to oppose sin. It wins its crowds by amusing them and its converts by hiding from them the full implications of the Christian message. It carries on its projects after the ballyhoo methods of American business. Well might we paraphrase Wordsworth and cry, \"Elijah, thou shouldst be living at this hour; America has need of thee.\" We stand in desperate need of a few men like Elijah who will dare to face up to the brazen sinners who dictate our every way of life. Sin in the full proportions of a revolution or a plague has all but destroyed our civilization while church people have played like children in the marketplace. What has happened to the spirit of the American Christian? Has our gold become dim? Have we lost the spirit of discernment till we can no longer recognize our captors? How much longer will we hide in caves while Ahab and Jezebel continue to pollute the temple and ravage the land? Surely we should give this some serious thought and prayer before it is too late—if indeed it is not too late already.','Isaiah 59:15','Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice.','In our culture today there seem to be only two absolutes: (1) that there are no absolutes except that there are no absolutes; and (2) everything must be tolerated, since there is no absolute truth. As painful and uncomfortable as it is, we must stand up for God&rsquo;s truth.','Father, give me courage and boldness to lovingly and graciously stand for You in my sphere of influence. May I be Your ambassador.'),(411,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Six',' Power Requires Separation','15','When Fish Catch the Fisherman','History shows clearly enough that true spirituality has never at any time been the possession of the masses. In any given period since the fall of the human race, only a few persons ever discerned the right way or walked in God\'s law. God\'s truth has never been popular. Wherever Christianity becomes popular, it is not on its way to die—it has already died. Popular Judaism slew the prophets and crucified Christ. Popular Christianity killed the Reformers, jailed the Quakers and drove John Wesley into the streets. When it comes to religion, the crowds are always wrong. At any time there are a few who see, and the rest are blinded. To stand by the truth of God against the current religious vogue is always unpopular and may be downright dangerous. The historic church, while she was a hated minority group, had a moral power that made her terrible to evil and invincible before her foes. When the Roman masses, without change of heart, were made Christian by baptism, Christianity gained popularity and lost her spiritual glow. From there she went on to adopt the ways of Rome and to follow her pagan religions. The fish caught the fisherman, and what started out to be the conversion of Rome became finally the conversion of the church. From that ignominious captivity, the church has never been fully delivered.','John 15:19','If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.','That the world hates us because we are disciples of Christ is a positive indication that we are indeed following Him. If the world welcomes us as disciples of Christ, alarms go off. How closely are we walking with Him?','Lord, help me to express Your love to the people of the world without conforming to the world.'),(412,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Six',' Power Requires Separation','16','In the World But Not of It','We are sent to bless the world, but never are we told to compromise with it. Our glory lies in a spiritual withdrawal from all that builds on dust. The bee finds no honey while crawling around the hive. Honey is in the flower far away, where there is quiet and peace and the sun and the flowing stream; there the bee must go to find it. The Christian will find slim pickings where professed believers play and pray all in one breath. He may be compelled sometimes to travel alone or at least to go with the ostracized few. To belong to the despised minority may be the price he must pay for power. But power is cheap at any price.','John 17:14-16','I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.','In the world but not of the world—a distinction often difficult to maintain. God\'s enablement is the only means.','Oh Lord, may I experience Your power to be in the world but not of it. May I be light to it. For Jesus\' sake.'),(413,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Seven',' The Right Direction Is Forward!','17',' Making the Most of Today',' We have little sympathy for the psychology expressed in the various \"Back To\" movements among Christians today. Our direction is not back, but forward. Few acts are as futile as sitting down and singing \"Backward, turn backward, O Time, in thy flight.\" We cannot turn the clock back. We cannot bring back better days. And it is not necessary or desirable that we should. If by means of some fantastic \"time machine\" one of us were permitted to go backward and visit some favorite period of the past, he would in all probability find the experience extremely disappointing. He would find himself a kind of anachronism, wholly out of place and thoroughly unhappy. To each one it is given to occupy his own spot in history. He must, like David, do the will of God by serving his own generation. It is in his own day that he must meet God in satisfying encounter. It is in his today, not in some pensive yesterday, that he must explore the riches of divine grace, do his allotted work and win his crown. Psychologists attribute certain abnormal mental conditions to an unconscious desire to escape the responsibilities of adult life by returning to the quiet and security of the prenatal state. Our habit of trying to recapture the spiritual glow of some better time by going backward creates a suspicion that we have lost the will to fight and are retiring to a safer spot behind the lines where we can sit down in peace to dream of armies defeated and battles won.',' Psalm 118:24','This is the day the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.',' Today is an opportunity to know God and to serve Him. We no longer have yesterday and may have left no tomorrows. But today is uniquely God-given.',' My tendency, Lord, is to look back or forward. In doing so, I often miss the strategic value of today. Thank You for this day.'),(414,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Seven',' The Right Direction Is Forward!','18','Let Us Draw Near Today','Today is our day. No one at any time has ever had any spiritual graces that we at this time cannot enjoy if we will meet the terms on which they are given. If these times are morally darker, they but provide a background against which we can shine the brighter. Our God is the God of today as well as of yesterday, and we may be sure that wherever our tomorrows may carry us, our faithful God will be with us as He was with Abraham and David and Paul. Those great men did not need us then, and we cannot have them with us now. Amen. So be it. And God be praised. We cannot have them, but we can have that which is infinitely better—we can have their God and Father, and we can have their Savior, and we can have the same blessed Holy Spirit that made them great.','Hebrews 10:22, 24','Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water ... And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.','The God of our mothers and fathers is with us. He is with us no less than He was with them. To Him we may draw near and by His Spirit encourage one another.','Thank You, Father, for the invitation to draw near to You. To get closer to You than I have ever been before. I come in Jesus\' name.'),(415,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Seven',' The Right Direction Is Forward!','19',' Let\'s Go On!',' The will of God is always the proper goal for every one of us. Where God is must be the place of desire. Any motion toward God is a forward motion. Even repentance is not a retreat toward the past but a decided march into a more glorious future. Restitution is not a return to yesterday but a step into a blessed tomorrow. There is such a thing as going backward in the spiritual life. There is such a thing as a retreat from a spiritual position once held by us as individual Christians. And there is such a thing as denominations and missionary societies making a wholesale withdrawal from ground once won at tremendous cost. If we find that we have gone back, then we should immediately reverse the direction and again go forward. The great truths of superior spiritual experiences, of high levels of personal living, of rapturous communion with the Three Persons of the Godhead, of victory over the flesh, of the gifts and power of the Spirit: what has happened to these? Once they marked us out and made us peculiar. What about it today? These are fair questions and they demand an answer. If candid self-examination reveals a departure from the green pastures where once our fathers grazed, what then? Let there be no wasting of time in a futile mooning over the past. Rather let us arise and go! Let us go forward to a new and better place in God. The land lies before us. Let us go in and take it.',' Hebrews 6:1, 3','Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity ... And God permitting, we will do so.',' Let\'s go on to maturity! Let\'s grow in Christ! Christ wants us to know Him, to experientially know Him. Let\'s make it our highest priority.',' From Your Word, Lord, from the lives of Your people, I know there are bridges to cross and mountains to climb that take me deeper into You. I want to go on by Your Spirit!'),(416,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Eight',' On the Public Reading of the Scriptures','20','Keeping the Message of the Bible Central','The Bible is the most important book in the world, and for Christians it is just about the only book—certainly the only book that should claim the place of honor in the public worship of God. We are, we trust, duly grateful for every good spiritual book written since the close of the New Testament canon. We do not undervalue the devotional book or the carefully prepared theological work, but when saints meet in communion there should be but one book, the Bible. The place given to the Scriptures by the different churches may be learned from the very architecture of the building in which their congregations gather. The ritualistic church builds itself around the altar. Toward that altar all eyes are directed and around that altar various and sundry choirs are ranged, to chant or respond or sing as the occasion may demand. The typical Protestant church is quite different. Its center of interest is the pulpit, and upon that pulpit rests a copy of the Bible printed in the language of the people. Preachers may come and preachers may go, but that old pulpit Bible remains. There it lies while generations pass, a source of light in the world\'s darkness, a fountain of pure water in the world\'s barren desert. And that minister is considered the best who can expound its sweet mysteries. Lack of oratorical gifts will be forgiven if the man of God will but open the Book and give his hearers to eat of the heavenly manna.','2 Timothy 2:15','Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.','The pulpit has been replaced by the small podium or just empty space. Preachers seem to walk miles around the platform. But the pulpit Bible remains a source of light in the world&rsquo;s darkness, a fountain of pure water in the world&rsquo;s barren desert.','Lord, may Your Word be central in our church services. May it be clearly and carefully presented so that we might grow.'),(417,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Eight',' On the Public Reading of the Scriptures','21',' The Word of God',' Of course we of this generation cannot know by firsthand experience how the Word of God was read in other times. But it would be hard to conceive of our fathers having done a poorer job than we do when it comes to the public reading of the Scriptures. Most of us read the Scriptures so badly that a good performance draws attention by its rarity. It could be argued that since everyone these days owns his own copy of the Scriptures, the need for the public reading of the Word is not as great as formerly. If that is true, then let us not bother to read the Scriptures at all in our churches. But if we are going to read the Word publicly, then it is incumbent upon us to read it well. A mumbled, badly articulated and unintelligent reading of the Sacred Scriptures will do more than we think to give the listeners the idea that the Word is not important. We do not, however, concur in the belief that because the Word has attained such wide circulation we should not read it in our public meetings. We should by all means read it, and we should make the reading a memorable experience for those who hear. Every man who is honored with the leadership of public worship should learn to read well. And do not imagine that anyone who can read at all can read well. Even learned men break down here. We are all familiar with those public figures who can talk fluently on almost any subject but flunk out miserably when they try to quote the Scriptures. Reading the Bible well is something not picked up overnight.',' Nehemiah 8:3','He [Ezra] read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.',' Ezra read the Book of the Law of Moses to the people from daybreak till noon. There was no public address system. Ezra must have read well. The people stood and listened attentively.',' O God, help us to read Your Word well and to listen attentively. For it is Your Word.'),(418,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Eight',' On the Public Reading of the Scriptures','22',' Public Bible-Reading as Part of Worship',' To read the Bible well in public we must first love it. The voice, if it is free, unconsciously follows the emotional tone. Reverence cannot be simulated. No one who does not feel the deep solemnity of the Holy Word can properly express it. God will not allow His Book to become the plaything of the rhetorician. That is why we instinctively draw back from every simulated tone in the reading of the Scriptures. The radio announcer\'s artificial unction cannot hide the absence of the real thing. The man who stands to declaim the Scriptures like a schoolboy reciting a passage from Hamlet can only leave his hearers with a feeling of disappointment. They know they have been cheated, though most of them could not tell just how. Again, to read the Bible well, one must know what the words mean and allow them to mean just that, without putting any body English on the passage to make it take a turn of meaning not found in the text. Probably the hardest part of learning to read well is eliminating ourselves. We read best when we get ourselves out of the transaction and let God talk through the imperfect medium of our voice. The beginner should read aloud whole books of the Bible in the privacy of his own room. In that way he can learn to hear his own voice and will know how he sounds to others. Let him consult a pronouncing Bible to learn the correct pronunciations of the names and places of the Bible. Let him cultivate the habit of reading slowly and distinctly with the reverence and dignity proper to the subject matter. Surely Protestants deserve a better sort of Scripture reading than they are now getting in our churches. And we who do the reading are the only ones who can give it to them.',' 1 Timothy 4:13',' Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.',' Public reading of the Scripture is closely related to preaching and teaching. Certainly preaching and teaching need to be done well but so does the public reading of the Scripture. All are part of corporate church worship.',' May we read Your Word from our hearts, Father, and may we listen with our hearts when we hear it read.'),(419,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Nine',' The Spiritual Love of Jesus','23',' Loving God and Our Neighbor',' The whole of true religion can be summed up in the spiritual love of Jesus. To love God and to love our neighbor was said by our Lord to be the fulfilling of the law and the prophets. All Christians believe that God reveals Himself as Christ; so the love of Jesus is in truth the love of God. Love as experienced by human beings may be on either of two levels, the human or the divine. These are not the same. They differ not only in intensity and elevation but in kind. Human love is undoubtedly the best thing left to the human race. Though it is often perverted and sometimes degraded, it is still Adam\'s best product, and without it, life on earth would be unendurable. Let us imagine what the world would be like if every trace of human love were suddenly removed. The heart recoils from the contemplation of such a horror. Without love, earth would not differ from hell except for the difference of location. Let us treasure what is left of love among the sons of men. It is not perfect, but it makes life bearable and even sweet here below. But human love is not divine love and should never be confused with it. Among the sentimental religionists, the two are accepted as being the very same and no distinctions are made. This is a great moral blunder and one that leads to spiritual frustration and disappointment. If we are to think clearly and pray rightly, we must recognize the difference between love that is merely human and that other love which cometh down from above. Charles Wesley knew the difference and made it clear in his famous lines: Love divine, all loves excelling, Joy of heaven, to earth come down. Here all grades and degrees of human love are acknowledged, and the true love which comes down from heaven is placed above them as far as the heaven is above the earth. This is not only good poetry, it is good theology as well.',' 1 John 4:10-11',' This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.','God\'s love for us is John 3:16 kind of love. It is only with God\'s love that we can love one another—love not only the lovable but the terribly unlovable.',' Your love, O God, is so deep, so wide. Grant increased understanding of it so that I may love others with Your love. In Christ\'s name.'),(420,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Nine',' The Spiritual Love of Jesus','24',' \"Spiritual\" Love','The human heart can love the human Jesus as it can love the human Lincoln, but the spiritual love of Jesus is something altogether different from and infinitely superior to the purest love the human heart can know. Indeed, it is not possible to love Jesus rightly except by the Holy Spirit. Only the third Person of the Trinity can love the second Person in a manner pleasing to the Father. The spiritual love of Jesus is nothing else but the Spirit in us loving Christ the Eternal Son. Christ, after the flesh, receives a great deal of fawning attention from the liberal and the modernist, but love that is not the outflow of the indwelling Holy Spirit is not true spiritual love and cannot be acceptable to God. We do Christ no honor when we do no more than to give Him the best of our human love. Even though we love Him better than we love any other man, still it is not enough if He merely wins first place in competition with Socrates or Walt Whitman. He is not rightly loved until He is loved as very God of very God, and the Spirit within us does the loving. There is much in present-day gospel circles that illustrates the distinction we are pointing out. A great many loud protestations of love for Christ leave the discerning heart with the impression that they are but sounding brass and tinkling cymbals. Innumerable sweet love ballads are sung to Jesus by persons who have never known the inward illumination of the Holy Spirit or felt the shock that comes with a true sight of the sinful pollution of nature.','John 21:16','Again Jesus said, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me?\" He answered, \"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Take care of my sheep.\"','The love Christ asks of us is not the sentimental kind with emotional outbursts tearfully expressed. Love for Him is expressed in loving His sheep—releasing to people the love of Christ produced by the indwelling Spirit.','Father, teach me to love with that love which is part of the Fruit of the Spirit produced in me as I walk daily by the Spirit. That is spiritual love.'),(421,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Nine',' The Spiritual Love of Jesus','25',' Meaningful Love','While the all-important distinction between the human and the spiritual love of Jesus is one that must be discerned, and one which can scarcely be explained, we yet venture to point out some marks which may distinguish the two. Reverence, for one thing, will always be present in the heart of the one who loves Christ in the Spirit. The Spirit gives a holy solemnity to every thought of Jesus, so that it is psychologically impossible to think of the true Christ with humor or levity. Neither can there be any unbecoming familiarity. The Person of Christ precludes all such. Then, self-abasement is always found in the heart that loves Jesus with true spiritual love. When Paul saw Jesus, he fell on his face. John fell down as dead, and every soul that ever saw and felt the terror and wonder of His glorious Presence, has known some such experience of self-abasement. It is important that we know whether our relation to Jesus is divine or human. It will pay us to find out now.',' John 15:9-10',' As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father\'s commands and remain in his love.',' Christ has loved us as the Father loved Him. We are to live in Christ\'s love. That love will be shown to Him by obeying Him, not merely to escape the results of disobedience, but because we love Him.',' O Lord, forgive me for those sentimental outbursts of which I am sometimes guilty which are supposed to express love. If I really love You I will obey You, worship You.'),(422,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Ten',' Our Christian Obligation to Care','26','Living as Light in the World','Whether or not the Christian should separate himself from the world is not open to debate; the question was settled by the sacred Scriptures, an authority from which there can be no appeal. The New Testament is very plain: ?They are not of the world,? said our Lord, ?even as I am not of the world.? James wrote, ?Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.? John said, ?Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.? Such teaching as this would appear to be plain enough, and there should be no doubt about what is intended. But we must never underestimate the ability of the human mind to get lost on a paved highway in broad daylight. Some well-intentioned souls have managed to get themselves confused about their relation to the world and have sought to escape it by hiding from it. They read into the biblical command to separate from the world the idea of complete withdrawal from all human activities and seek peace of heart by cutting themselves off, as far as possible, from the great stream of human life and thought. And that is not good.','Matthew 5:14-16','You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.','If God had wanted us completely out of the world He could have taken us home to heaven at the time of our spiritual birth. No, we are to be in the world but not of it. We are to shine as light in world-system darkness.','Forgive me, Lord, for unhealthy accommodation to the world in which I live. May I not forget that I am a stranger here with citizenship in heaven—but a stranger ablaze with the light of Christ.'),(423,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Ten',' Our Christian Obligation to Care','27',' Living as Relatives to Humankind',' We human beings were made for each other, and what any of us is doing at any time cannot be a matter of indifference to the rest of us. On the human plane all men are brothers. The Son of Man never denied this sweet tie with humankind. Over a stubborn and sinful Jerusalem He frankly shed tears and, in the hour of death, prayed for men who were so blind as to nail their God on a tree. And Paul, who burned always to be like his Lord, wept over the unbelieving Israel with an anguish that goaded him to an utterance so daring as to cause the ages to wonder: \"I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.\" Peace of heart that is won by refusing to bear the common yoke of human sympathy is a peace unworthy of a Christian. To seek tranquility by stopping our ears to the cries of human pain is to make ourselves not Christians but a kind of degenerate stoic having no relation either to stoicism or Christianity. We Christians should never try to escape from the burdens and woes of life among men. The hermit and the anchorite sound good in poetry, but stripped of their artificial romance, they are not good examples of what the followers of Christ should be. True peace comes not by a retreat from the world but by the overpowering presence of Christ in the heart. \"Christ in you\" is the answer to our cry for peace. The Salvation Army lassie distributing gospel literature in a saloon is a better example of the separated life than a prim and cold-faced saint who has long ago fled the world to take refuge in the barren caverns of her soul.',' 2 Peter 3:9',' The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.',' The Lord does not want anyone to perish. Do I? Do I care enough to pray and to reach out in His name?','Father, to the extent I can bear it, will you enable me to see people as You see them?'),(424,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Ten',' Our Christian Obligation to Care','28',' Living as Good Samaritans',' The testimony of the true follower of Christ might well be something like this: The world\'s pleasures and the world\'s treasures henceforth have no appeal for me. I reckon myself crucified to the world and the world crucified to me. But the multitudes that were so dear to Christ shall not be less dear to me. If I cannot prevent their moral suicide, I shall at least baptize them with my human tears. I want no blessing that I cannot share. I seek no spirituality that I must win at the cost of forgetting that men and women are lost and without hope. If in spite of all I can do they will sin against light and bring upon themselves the displeasure of a holy God, then I must not let them go their sad way unwept. I scorn a happiness that I must purchase with ignorance. I reject a heaven that I must enter by shutting my eyes to the sufferings of my fellow men. I choose a broken heart rather than any happiness that ignores the tragedy of human life and human death. Though I, through the grace of God in Christ, no longer lie under Adam\'s sin, I would still feel a bond of compassion for all of Adam\'s tragic race, and I am determined that I shall go down to the grave or up into God\'s heaven mourning for the lost and the perishing. And thus and thus will I do as God enables me. Amen',' Luke 10:36-37','\"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\" The expert in the law replied, \"The one who had mercy on him.\" Jesus told him, \"Go and do likewise.\"','Good Samaritan living does not come naturally. We are afraid of rejection, of being robbed ourselves, of being taken advantage of. But intercession for those around us will eventually result in reaching out to them in Christ\'s name.',' O Lord, help me to see people, people around me, as You see them. To pray for them. To reach out to them. To be a \"Good Samaritan\" to them. I can\'t do it myself, I\'ve tried. Change me, for Christ\'s sake.'),(425,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twelve',' \"I\'m a Stranger Here Myself\"','29','Wrestling with those Unanswerable Questions','All of us at some time in our life become suddenly aware that we are in a strange place called the world. We do not remember coming here and we are not sure when or how we are going to leave. A score of pressing questions fill our minds. We must have the answers. Where did we come from? What are we? Why are we here? Where do we go next? What does God require of us? How can we find the heaven of peace? Such questions as these insist upon an answer. But we have no answer. Then we approach someone who looks as if he might know. We eagerly put our question, but we get only a shake of the head and the usual, \"I\'m sorry. I\'m a stranger here myself.\" At first we are frightfully disappointed, for we had hoped someone might know. There are the great stone buildings covered with ivy where the best brains of the world hold forth day after day. There are the great libraries piled with solemn books, each filled with learned words. But the desired answer is nowhere. A few attempt to direct us, but prove by their own bewilderment that they know as little as we do about the whole thing. The philosopher seeks, but never finds. The scientist searches, but finds no data to help us beyond the last hour and the narrow house and the shroud. The poet soars on stubby wings, but soon comes down again, tired and confused. Each one has the same answer: \"I\'m sorry. . . . I\'m a stranger here myself.\"','Psalm 147:5','Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.','God\'s understanding has no limit, but ours does. He is God. We are created humans. There is so much we do not understand, have not experienced, and cannot comprehend. Some of our questions will never be answered in this life. Others will not need to be. But we can trust God\'s sovereign plan.','Father, those burning questions for which I have found no answer I bring to You. Into Your arms I place them and I place myself. You are my Abba.'),(426,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twelve',' \"I\'m a Stranger Here Myself\"','30',' God\'s Word Gives Light','\"I\'m sorry. ... I\'m a stranger here myself.\" That is the only honest answer. Others are sometimes given, but they are never valid answers. They spring out of pride or error or uncritical and wishful thinking, and they are not to be trusted. It is no good asking for information of another who is as ignorant as ourselves. We are all strangers in a strange world. Is our state hopeless then? Is no answer to be had? Must we live in a world we do not understand and go out into a future of dark uncertainty? No, thank God, things are not as bad as that. There is an answer. We can find light. Our questions have been answered. \"From a child,\" wrote Paul to Timothy, \"thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.\" It is the universal testimony of the saints of the ages that when the light of the Scriptures enters, the darkness of spiritual ignorance vanishes. God\'s Word giveth light. It has an answer for every question that matters. The merely curious question it ignores, but every real inquiry made by the sincere heart is met with full light. It is important that we search the Scriptures daily, and more important still that we approach them with faith and humility, bowing our hearts to their instructions and commands. Then through faith in Christ we cease to be strangers and become sons of God.',' Psalm 119:130',' The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.','God\'s words give light to those most difficult of life issues. That light does not necessarily illuminate quickly nor to our full satisfaction. Imperative is careful searching of God\'s Word and serious listening to His voice. But God does give light!',' Father, You are God. You know all things. You are from forever to forever. To You I come with those burning questions. Your answers to some I cannot yet understand. My mind is restricted and my experience limited. Yet in You I find light and peace.'),(427,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirteen',' We Must Think Like Christians','31','Distinguishing What is Caesar\'s and What is God\'s','One thing must be kept in mind: We Christians are Christians first and everything else after that. Our first allegiance is to the kingdom of God. Our citizenship is in heaven. We are grateful for political freedom. We thank God for democracy as a way of life. But we never forget that we are sons of God and citizens of another city whose builder and maker is God. For this reason, we must not identify the gospel with any political system or make Christianity to be synonymous with any form of government, however noble. Christ stands alone, above and outside of every ideology devised by man. He does not join any of our parties or take sides with any of our great men except as they may come over on His side and try to follow Him in righteousness and true holiness. Then He is for them, but only as individuals, never as leaders of some political faction. The true Christian will be loyal to his country and obedient to those in authority, but he will never fall into the error of confusing his own national culture with Christianity. Christianity is bigger than any country, loftier than any civilization, broader than any human ideology.','Matthew 22:21b','Then he said to them, \"Give to Caesar what is Caesar\'s, and to God what is God\'s.\"','We have dual citizenship—God\'s kingdom and a nation of the world. To that country\'s government we have responsibility—laws to follow, taxes to pay, duties inherent in citizenship. Being good citizens will mean working to change what needs to be changed while remaining true to our King Jesus.','Your kingdom, Lord, includes followers of Christ from differing ethnic groups, social classes, political persuasions. Oh God, help me to accept the diversity while rejoicing in family. For Jesus\' sake.'),(428,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirteen',' We Must Think Like Christians','32','Everyone\'s Savior','It may shock some people to be told that Christ is not an American. Nor was He a Jew merely. He was born of the seed of Abraham of the line of David, and His mother was a Jewess of the tribe of Judah. Still Christ is vastly more than a Jew. His dearest name for himself was \"the Son of man.\" He came through the Jewish race, but he came to the human race. He is Everyman\'s countryman and Everyman\'s contemporary. He is building a kingdom of all nations and tribes and tongues and peoples. He has no favorites, \"but in every nation he that fearest him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.\" Let us remember that the gospel is a divine thing. It receives no virtue from any of man\'s religions or philosophies. It came down to us out of heaven, a separate thing, like Peter\'s sheet, wholly on its own. It is something given of God. It operates in the individual heart wherever that heart may be found. Any form of human government, however lofty, deals with the citizen only as long as he lives. At the graveside it bids him adieu. It may have made his journey a little easier, and, if so, all lovers of the human race will thank God for that. But in the cool earth, slaves and free men lie down together. Then what matter the talk and the turmoil? Who was right and who was wrong in this or that political squabble doesn\'t matter to the dead. Judgment and sin and heaven and hell are all that matter then. So, let\'s keep cool, and let\'s think like Christians. Christ will be standing upright, tall and immortal, after the tumult and the shouting dies and the captains and the kings lie stretched side by side, the \"cause\" that made them famous forgotten and their whole significance reduced to a paragraph in a history book.','John 1:14a','The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.','Christ did not come to a particular people in a particular area of the world. He assumed a certain ethnicity. He took on full humanity. But He came to be the Savior and Lord of every man and woman. He belongs to all peoples who will open their hearts to Him.','O Christ, You are praised and worshiped today in hundreds of languages and cultural forms. You are no more my Lord than the Lord of other believers around the world. But You are my Lord and my God.'),(429,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Fourteen',' On Going to God First','33','Making God Our First Resort','It is characteristic of human nature to turn to God only after every other avenue of help has been explored and been found useless. This is one of the many evils which sin has visited upon us—the bent to look everywhere for aid but in the right place, and if we do look in the right place, to look there last. No one likes to think that he has been a second choice, but our patient Heavenly Father lies under the shadow of always being at least second, and often third or fifth or tenth choice. For most of us will have to confess that we sought God only after all else had failed. When one friend after another had rejected our pleas, we turned in despair to the God who never rejects anyone who comes to Him in sincerity and faith. The old country woman \"lowed\" that it was no use to pray in a crisis if you hadn\'t been in the habit of praying before. \"For,\" said she, \"God doesn\'t hear skeered prayers.\" There may be a certain logic about her reasoning, but her conclusion is all at variance with the facts and with the gentle ways of God with erring men. For since our fathers fell asleep, the kingdom of heaven has continued to receive \"skeered\" persons of all ages and conditions who found the world too much for them and who in their grief and despair sought help where help can indeed be found.','Psalm 73:23-24','Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand. You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.','Why don\'t we turn to God first? Is it because we are not ready to bend to His will? Do we reason that other entities might be faster with remedies more to our liking? Or have we restricted God to a secondary place in daily living?','Father, thank You for Your patience when I act so stupidly, trying every supposed remedy but You. What unfailing love You have shown to me.'),(430,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Fourteen',' On Going to God First','34','God the True Source of Help and Comfort','No one need feel ashamed if he has come to God as a last resort, especially if he has found the help he sought \"in the bosom of his Father and his God.\" God has received a great army of such persons, and if He is satisfied, we should be. Billy Sunday once testified that he had been scared into the kingdom of God. \"But,\" said he, \"by the grace of God I\'m not going to be scared out.\" But be all this as true as it may be, still it is a bad habit for us as Christians to get into-the habit of trying everything before taking our problems to God. God should come first. If in our sinful ignorance we once knew no better, there is no reason for our continuing in the same rut now that we are children of the kingdom. It cheats us out of many a victory and leaves us for long periods in a state of perplexity and distress when we might be walking in freedom without a care in the world. Going to God first will head off many a bad situation. A young man falls in love and without as much as a word of counsel from God plunges into marriage. A few years later he finds that he has made a bad mistake. Then he goes to God to seek a way out, and learns that he is too late. God will still help him even in such circumstances, but the sacred vows have been taken, and the die is cast. It would have been better to go to God first. Our chastenings come when we look somewhere else for help and neglect the one real source of all help and comfort. It\'s always best to go to God first.','Psalm 25:9','He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.','What pain and regret we cause ourselves when we fail to go to God first. When we are sure we are in God\'s will then trial and sorrow change drastically in color. We know that out of His infinite riches in Christ Jesus, grace God gives and gives and gives','Thank You for Your guidance and Your grace, Lord. I am such a debtor to Your grace which is mine through Christ.'),(431,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Fifteen',' The Christian\'s Obligation to Be Joyful','35',' Faith and Moods',' Faith is at the foundation of all Christian living, and because faith has to do with the character of God, it is safe from all vacillations of mood. A man may be believing soundly and effectively even when his mood is low, so low that he is hardly aware that he is alive emotionally at all. That is one thing, and it is good to know and still better to put in practice. But like every other truth, it has two sides. Our trouble today is that we tend to forget the other side, that is, that elevated spiritual mood is a tremendous aid to victorious living. The relation of faith to mood may be stated by means of a number of metaphors: if faith is the tree, mood is the blossom; if faith is the flower, mood is the fragrance; if faith is the instrument, mood is the melody. And who will deny the vital place of the blossom, the fragrance and the music in human life? Mood is a kind of mental weather. There is weather in which nothing will grow. The farmer knows the damage done by prolonged periods of cold, wet weather in the spring after the seed has been planted. Sometimes the seed will rot in the ground, requiring a new planting with all the loss and extra work this entails. Weather may be too hot, too cold, too dry, too wet to favor good crops, and the Christian\'s moods, in like manner, may be unfavorable to spiritual growth and fruitfulness. Christian service carried on during prolonged heaviness of heart may be as good as wasted.',' 2 Corinthians 5:7',' We live by faith, not by sight.',' We walk by faith not by sight, mood or feeling. There are times when faith is all we have in the midst of darkness. There are also times when faith lifts mood and elevates feeling.',' Thank You, Lord, for the bright moods and joyfulness. Keep me from becoming unduly dependent upon them.'),(432,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Fifteen',' The Christian\'s Obligation to Be Joyful','36',' The Joy of the Lord','The Christian owes it to the world to be supernaturally joyful. In this day of universal apprehension when men\'s hearts are failing them for fear of those things that are coming upon the earth, we Christians are strategically placed to display a happiness that is not of this world and to exhibit a tranquility that will be a little bit of heaven here below. All this takes for granted that sin has been dealt with by sincere repentance and thorough amendment of life. It assumes that we are walking in the light of truth, for true joy cannot be artificially induced. The \"keep smiling\" school of applied psychology is not even remotely related to the true faith of Christ. The chief fun of the comedian and the good humor of the wit who is the life of the party are like flowers growing on old graves, briefly interesting, but evanescent and always touched with sadness. But the fountain of Christian joy flows out from the throne of God, pure, refreshing and sweet everlastingly.',' John 15:11',' I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.',' It was Tertullian who said that the Christian saint is hilarious. The closer one comes to God, the more joy is experienced. Joy based not on circumstances or passing emotion but the joy of the Lord that comes from knowing Him.',' O Lord, the reality of being Yours opens my heart to the flow of Your joy. Thank You!'),(433,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Sixteen',' It Seemed Good in Thy Sight','37',' Those Matters Beyond Human Understanding',' A determination to know what cannot be known always works harm to the Christian heart. Ignorance in matters on our human level is never to be excused if there has been opportunity to correct it. But there are matters which are obviously \"too high for us.\" These we should meet in trusting faith and say as Jesus said, \"Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.\" There are things that we can never understand until we have the benefit of advanced experience and the addition of a light beyond anything we possess at present. Under those circumstances it is not good to attempt to understand. Confessed ignorance becomes us better. Human curiosity and pride often combine to drive us to try to understand acts of God which are plainly outside the field of human understanding. We dislike to admit that we do not know what is going on, so we torture our minds trying to fathom the mysterious ways of the Omniscient One. It\'s hard to conceive of a more fruitless task. For instance, a child which had been long desired and prayed for is suddenly taken away. The parents are prostrated with grief, and to add to their suffering comes the torturing thought that they should know why it all happened, but do not. Then begins the long, painful attempt to learn the secret of life and death. Why did this happen? What does God have in mind? These poor friends bruise their minds cruelly trying to fathom the unfathomable. We may as well learn (and the earlier the better) that God has no private secretaries who are on the inside of the secrets of eternity. All God wanted to say, He has said in the Scriptures. Beyond that we show the greatest wisdom simply to remain still before Him and whisper, \"Even so, Father.\" To the adoring heart, the best and most satisfying explanation for anything always will be, \"It seemed good in thy sight.\"',' Isaiah 55:8-9','\"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,\" declares the LORD. \"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\"',' There are mysteries God deigns to unlock for humankind and there are other mysteries that will always remain just that. We sometimes confuse the two categories.',' Thank You, God, that I am not God. For the foolishness of sometimes trying to be, forgive me.'),(434,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Seventeen',' Coworkers, Not Competitors','38',' Family Matters',' It is too bad that anything so obvious should need to be said at this late date, but from all appearances, we Christians have about forgotten the lesson so carefully taught by Paul: God\'s servants are not to be competitors, but co-workers. In any religious work there are two interests, either of which may be served: the spiritual interest or the natural; the divine or the human; our own or God\'s. And it is altogether possible to serve our own interests with poured-out devotion. It is possible to serve the flesh even while engaged in the most intense sort of religious activities. The very fact that our activities are religious will sometimes disguise the presence of the rankest kind of selfishness. It is impossible for two servants of Christ to compete as long as the work they are doing is God\'s work. When the spirit of competition enters, we may be sure that the work of God is no longer being done. God is one; it is wholly impossible for Him to compete with Himself. As long as His Spirit is in control there can be no such thing as competition among those who are under that control. The Spirit achieves cooperation, always, and makes of His servants not competitors, but co-workers.',' 1 Corinthians 3:9',' For we are God\'s fellow workers; you are God\'s field, God\'s building.','The church, its servants, its people are God\'s. There is, then, no basis and no room for competition. Just as there is no competition in the Godhead.','Father, varied are the traditions, the interpretation of certain biblical passages, and the gifts of my brothers and sisters in Christ. But we are one family. We are co-workers for Your glory. May I treat them as co-workers, not competitors.'),(435,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Seventeen',' Coworkers, Not Competitors','39','Cultivating the Psychology of Cooperation','A local church, as long as it is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, cannot entertain the psychology of competition. When it begins to compete with another church, it is a true church of God no longer; it has voided its character and gone down onto a lower level. The Spirit that indwells it is no longer divine; it is human merely, and its activities are pitched on the plane of the natural. Wherever the spirit of competition between brethren rears its head, there will be found carnality, selfishness and sin. The only way to deal with it is to tag it for what it is and put it away in the sorrows of repentance. The Holy Spirit always cooperates with Himself in His members. The Spirit-directed body does not tear itself apart by competition. The ambitions of the various members are submerged in the glory of the Head, and whatever brings honor to the Head meets with the most eager approval of the members. We should cultivate the idea that we are co-workers rather than competitors. We should ask God to give us the psychology of cooperation. We should learn to think of ourselves as being members in particular of one and the same body, and we should reject with indignation every suggestion of the enemy designed to divide our efforts.','1 Corinthians 3:6-7','I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.','Since the church, its ministry, its servants, its people are God\'s, ministers and people cooperate in serving and glorifying God. A physical body in which the individual members compete rather than cooperate illustrates the chaos that results when compet','By Your Spirit, Lord, remind me that I am one member of Your family. May I relate to other believers, other ministers as to family members with whom to cooperate not compete.'),(436,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Eighteen',' The Essence of Beauty','40',' Christ the Source of Moral Beauty','One thing the Bible teaches very plainly is that Christ is the sum of all virtues and the essence of all beauty. On this subject, modern Christians have a lot to learn. We have been cheated of this truth for the last half-century or more, the emphasis falling elsewhere. And we are always victims of the prevailing religious vogue. Whatever is getting the attention from our spiritual leaders is what we finally come to accept as orthodoxy in any given period of history. And right now we are definitely not hearing much about the loveliness of Jesus. Christ is God shining through the personality of a man, and shining unhindered. His sacred humanity does not veil His divine beauty in any degree. The Christ who lived among men showed forth the nature of God as certainly as if He had still been with His Father in the preincarnate state. There is no moral beauty but what Christ is the source of it. Every trait of lovely character we see in any believing man or woman is but an imperfect demonstration of how wonderful Jesus is. Even those moral beauties that appear to be \"natural\" to some people have their source in Him. For human goodness cannot exist apart from Christ. They are but broken lights of Thee, And Thou, O Christ, are more than they.',' Psalm 27:4',' One thing I ask of the LORD, this is what I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple.',' The more we gaze upon the moral beauty of the Lord, particularly as reflected in the human personality of Christ, the more we want to be like Him. Reflecting Christ\'s beauty in our own piece of the world points others to Him.',' Father, let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me. I\'ve seen shades of that beauty in the lives of some of Your children. May Your Spirit produce it in me. In Jesus\' name.'),(437,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Eighteen',' The Essence of Beauty','41',' Christ\'s Loveliness Reflected in His People',' Some good Christians are afraid to give notice to any lovely virtues which may appear here and there among God\'s people lest they detract from the glory of Christ. Such timidity is understandable, but uncalled for. If we know to begin with that all goodness is from Christ, that all sweetness, all holiness, all loveliness are out of Him and from Him and in Him, we will not hesitate to recognize moral excellence wherever it may occur on this dark planet. If a ray of holy light shines out from any man\'s life, it must be because Christ is there shining in secret in a human breast, and we should be quick to catch this dim glimpse of the Light of the World again incarnated in a human being. The glory of Christ will not suffer from this frank and eager acknowledgment of virtue where we find it. Because we are sentient beings, we must have some love-motivation to keep us running. This fact (on a lower level) is well known to everyone. God knew this (for He made us) and gave us the supreme love-Object of the universe to fire our hearts with holy passion. That Object is Jesus. The Christian faith may be summed up in the love of Jesus. To love Him enough is to be sweetly and wonderfully free. To love Him as He should be loved is to know at once complete release from religious forms and traditions. It is to reach the goal of life even here below.',' Psalm 90:17',' And let the loveliness of our Lord, our God, rest on us, confirming the work that we do. Oh, yes. Affirm the work that we do! (The Message).',' Experiencing Christ\'s love and loving Him brings a new dimension to daily living. We serve Him, we obey Him, we follow Him because we love Him! Have we opened ourselves to that love?',' May Your loveliness rest on me and all your people. It is that loveliness that confirms the work we do. We serve You as an expression of our love for You.'),(438,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Nineteen',' Free, but Not Independent','42',' Free Indeed!','It is a difficult thing to do, yet very necessary that we find a place of complete spiritual freedom and loving dependence upon one another. Here in the wide valley between two high and dangerous peaks is the broad dwelling of God\'s true and wise children. The spirit of complete inward freedom is a precious heritage from the cross and should be treasured as one of life\'s most wonderful possessions. It is our privilege to be wholly free from evil habits, from superstition, from the fear of men, from the slavery of popular customs, from the necessity of pleasing the self-elected dictators of society. Such freedom is wondrously delightful, near to the joy of heaven itself. The one whom the Son has set free is as free from others as if there were no others living in the world. He would walk with God in quiet inward liberty if no one else on earth were to go along with him. Yet such a happy soul has no feeling of independence; he is deeply conscious that he is a member of a larger body of which Christ is the head, and he willingly acknowledges his indebtedness to all other Christians. He thanks God for every one of His children and is eager to learn from all of them. He is grateful for \"holy men of God who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,\" for translators, expositors, teachers, intercessors, hymnists, and he thankfully acknowledges the part they all had in ministering to his own life the liberating things of the free Spirit.',' John 8:36',' So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.',' How much we owe to those men and women of God who have gone on before. From their experience and example we have learned much. Yet we, too, may walk with God, enjoying the freedom He gives while learning of Him through others who so walked.',' Father, I want to know that full freedom which is in Christ. I want to be free in the Spirit yet sensitive to what You teach me through other believers.'),(439,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Nineteen',' Free, but Not Independent','43','Dependent Freedom','There will always be danger from one or the other of these two extremes, slavish dependence or arrogant independence. Some Christians (by far the majority) will accept a place of timid conformity and surrender themselves to the bondage of authority and custom. In all things religious they will become meek followers of popular trends within their own circle. Such as these have no vision of their own, no true convictions, no inward freedom. They are slaves of the religious machine; they know nothing of the liberty with which Christ has made us free. The other extreme is found here and there among us, and while it never has as many followers as the cult of bondage, it is nevertheless quite well represented in orthodox circles. Its followers glorify freedom to a point where they deny their proper debt to fellow Christians and scorn the interdependence of the body. They are often contemptuous of spiritual authority, and they deny the right of Spirit-gifted men to exercise their gifts within the church. This breeds a kind of religious anarchy that is altogether unscriptural and, as might be expected, extremely injurious to the cause of true spirituality. Both extremes must be avoided. We must live in the paradox of happy dependent freedom.','Galatians 5:13','You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love.','Christ is the source of true freedom. He teaches us and leads us through other believers. But we are primarily servants to Him not to them. With our brothers and sisters in Christ we are fellow pilgrims, fellow servants. We serve Him in serving others. W','Thank You, Father, for freedom in Christ. Help me to guard against self-indulgence. May I freely serve others in love by Your enablement.'),(440,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty',' Convention or Crusade?','44',' \"Lord, Do It Again!\"','Such a fast hold does inertia have upon almost everything religious that it takes a powerful and sudden attack by determined forces to move anything. It takes something like a crusade to get anything done these days. The principle of laissez faire is so firmly implanted in all of us that something in the nature of an earthquake is needed to jar us loose and start us on the right way. It is an illuminating experience to read the history of the great spiritual movements that have blessed the world over the last 2,000 years. Scarely any of these began quietly; almost always they struck the earth with the suddenness of a cyclone. We have only to mention a few to prove our point: the ministry of John the Baptist, the appearance of Jesus Christ with His miracles, Pentecost, the Reformation, the Wesleyan revivals, the Great Awakening, revivals in Wales, in Korea, the strange and wonderful work under the Prophet Harris in Africa—the list is long. These movements struck with the unexpectedness of lightning and found people without a defense against them. Methodism, for instance, moved with the speed of a forest fire and took on the character of a crusade. The spiritual certainty within the hearts of a select few became so white-hot that it set others on fire around it and started an unplanned movement toward a return to New Testament standards and the deeper things of the Spirit.',' Habakkuk 3:2',' Lord, I have heard of your fame; I stand in awe of your deeds, O LORD. Renew them in our day, in our time make them known; in wrath remember mercy.',' True revival is not something we can manufacture. It must come from God. It is not about personalities and methods and strategies. It is God moving in sovereign power.',' O Lord, do it again! Stir Your Church with renewing power as You have done in times past. Send refreshing. In Jesus\' name.'),(441,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty',' Convention or Crusade?','45','Movements That Cease to Move','It is an illuminating experience to read the history of the great spiritual movements that have blessed the world over the last 2,000 years. Scarcely any of these began quietly; almost always they struck the earth with the suddenness of a cyclone. . . . History shows another fact also. When the first heat of the originators of great movements had spent itself after their death, immediately another spirit entered and took over—it was the spirit of conventionalism. It retained the outward form of the orginal movement but lost all the inward heat. The movement ceased to move; its adherents gained popularity and lost power; the apocalyptic quality of its message disappeared; its new teachers set about to make its teaching acceptable to Christendom—and their success became at last their greatest tragedy. It is a lamentable fact that the crusading spirit is almost wholly lost to the deeper life branches of the church. Modern crusaders are for the most part no more than high octane proselyters operating down on a level far below New Testament plateaus. They make all the noise and get all the notice, while hungry-hearted saints shake their heads in discouragement and wait for-what?','Psalm 85:6','Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?','Often God uses little people in bringing revival to His Church. People filled with the Spirit who are fully convinced of their weakness and unworthiness but firmly trusting in God\'s power. Many of us God could not use in reviving His Church. We would tak','Father, will You not revive us again? By Your Spirit cause our \"movement\" to move! Not by our might nor our power but by Your Spirit, O God.'),(442,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-One',' It Will Not Go away','46',' That Persistent Question',' A droll bit of advice sometimes given to persons who are being bothered by some disagreeable problem is, \"Let it alone and it will go away by itself.\" While the words are usually intended to be humorous, they express, better than many more serious words would do, an unfortunate habit which is altogether too prevalent among us. It is the habit of neglecting spiritual questions in the vague hope that they will stop bothering us and go away of themselves. We all come into the world with one tremendous question facing us, the question of our relation to the God from whose hand we came. None of the heavy problems propounded by philosophy can equal this one in vital significance and solemn meaning for the individual man. So important is it that it may properly be said that no other question really exists at all till this one has been settled. And it will not settle itself; it must be settled by each one of us personally and individually. lf we ignore it, it will not go away. It will be there to haunt us in the last day we spend on earth, and it will be there to face us in the day of judgment when it is too late to do anything about it. The question is not a philosophical one merely; it is not even a theological one. It is strictly personal. The deceitful human heart would like only too well to involve it in the fog of doctrinal argument and thus rob it of its real meaning. That is a common way to deal with it, but it is never a satisfactory way. The question will come back again out of the fog to demand a true answer, that is, a moral answer. What shall I do with my sin?',' Acts 2:37','When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\"',' Reflection: Sin. We may call it by less offensive terms. We may even dismiss it as nonexistent. But it is there. It stares at us in the mirror and in the lives of other people. Sin. My sin. What am I to do about it?',' Lord, that load of sin. Some of my sin others clearly see. Some of it I successfully hide from other people. But You know all about it. And You alone provide the remedy through Christ. Thank You!'),(443,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-One',' It Will Not Go away','47',' The World\'s Primary Problem','Two questions are embraced within the one problem: What shall I do with my sin? and what shall I do with Jesus which is called Christ? In spite of every effort of the pseudo-learned world to dispose of the sin question, it remains still, a perennial heartache to the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve. It is one of those persistent pains that lies deep in the soul and never quite stops hurting. It just won\'t go away. The devil and the busy sons of men have sought throughout the centuries for something to make this problem go away. They have invented how many thousands of amusements, they have created innumerable pleasures to take the mind off its central woe; but nothing works. Sin is still the world\'s first problem. The second question, What shall I do with Jesus? is the answer to the first one, because Jesus came to save men from their sins. Let us answer the second one rightly and the first one will be solved automatically. If we but come to Jesus with our sin upon us and without any hope except His mercy, we shall surely be delivered from the ancient curse. But remember, sin demands an answer. It won\'t just go away. It must be carried away by redeeming blood, and redeeming blood was never shed by any other lamb except the Lamb of God.',' 1 Peter 2:24',' He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.',' Christ has died for your sin and mine. Not just the sin of the past which we have confessed and for which we have asked forgiveness but sin in the future which we shall confess. What unfailing love! What amazing grace!',' O Christ, You bore my sins in Your body on the cross. By Your wounds I am healed. You did it so that I might die to sins and live for righteousness. Lord, I want so to live!'),(444,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Two',' Who Is in Debt to Whom?','48',' Serving God\'s Purpose in This Generation','The life Ideal was described by the apostle in the Book of Acts: \"For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep.\" We submit that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to improve upon this. It embraces the whole sphere of religion, appearing as it does in its three directions: God, the individual, society. Within that simple triangle all possible human activities are carried on. To each of us there can be but these three dimensions: God, myself, others. Beyond this we cannot go, nor should we even attempt to go. If we serve God according to His own will, and in doing so serve our generation, we shall have accomplished all that is possible for any human being. David was smart enough to serve God and his generation before he fell asleep. To fall asleep before we have served our generation is nothing short of tragic. It is good to sleep at last, as all our honored fathers have done, but it is a moral calamity to sleep without having first labored to bless the world. No man has any right to die until he has put mankind in debt to him. No man has any moral right to lie down on the earth till he has wrought to take something of the earth out of the hearts of men, till he has helped to free men from the tyranny of that same earth and pointed them to that kingdom that will abide after the heavens and the earth are no more.',' Acts 13:36',' For when David had served God\'s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his fathers and his body decayed.',' David served God\'s purpose in his generation. What purpose does God have for you and me in our generation? Are we serving it?',' Father, I am not a David in spiritual strength, gifts or leadership. But I am Your servant where You have placed me. Reach out to people through me for Jesus\' sake.'),(445,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Two',' Who Is in Debt to Whom?','49',' Under Obligation','David\'s religion had social implications, but he was no mere do-gooder, no patcher-upper of the world\'s hurts. All his service was rendered according to the will of God. It was the divine quality in his ministry that made it immortal. Many good deeds may be done whose final effects will not be lasting. A sick man laboring to cure the ills of another sick man may be a moving sight, but it can hardly be a reassuring one, for both will die at last. But the service that can bring the healing touch of God into human life is infinitely to be preferred to any other. It is the will of God that brings eternity into human toil. We should remember that if we are to serve our generation we must get at it right away, for our generation will not be around long. Isaac Watts wrote: \"Time, like an ever rolling stream Bears all its sons away; They fly, forgotten, as a dream Dies at the opening day.\" We are all born in debt to the world, and that debt increases as we grow older. If we are wise in the Spirit, we shall see to it that we turn the tables and put the world in debt to us. This we can do only by serving our generation by the will of God before it is too late.',' Romans 1:14','I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.',' As was Paul so are we under obligation to share the Good News of Christ with people all around us. We are under obligation to share Christ by our life, our daily living and our words. People need the Lord!',' Holy Spirit, use even me. I\'m so weak, so small, so unimpressive. But reach out through me. For Christ\'s sake.'),(446,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Three',' True Service','50',' Serving God in Serving Others','Any serious-minded Christian may at some time find himself wondering whether the service he is giving to God is the best it could be. He may even have times of doubting, and fear that his toil is fruitless and his life empty. This is not as bad as it sounds, and may actually prove to be an excellent thing for him—if he knows how to use it. Christian service, like every other phase of religion, can become a very hollow affair. The church has marked out certain work and approved it as service acceptable to God, and for the most part the church has been right. But is should be kept in mind that it is not the kind or quantity of work that makes it true service—it is the quality. Before the judgment seat of Christ, very little will be heard of numbers or size; moral quality is about all that will matter then. If we are wise we will give attention now to the quality of our service; it is obvious that it will be too late to do anything about it when the service is ended and the account rendered up.',' Matthew 25:40','The King will reply, \"I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.\"',' We\'re inclined to try to serve better and harder if we serve in high profile and are amply rewarded in human adulation. Often service is of the highest quality when least noticed and recognized, except by the Lord.',' Father, help me to remember that it is You I serve in serving others, whether or not noticed and appreciated by others. It is You I serve.'),(447,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Three',' True Service','51',' Quality Service','The great weight of exhortation these days is in the direction of zeal and activity. \"Let\'s get going\" is the favorite watchword for gospel workers, with the result that everyone feels ashamed to sit down and think. But it will pay to do it, nevertheless. It would be a shock to most of us to learn just what God thinks of our breathless activity, and a greater shock to many to find out the true quality of our service as God sees it. For not all religious activity is accepted of God, not even when it appears to produce results and get things done. The Lord seeth not as man seeth. Christian service, to be accepted of God, must be fresh and sincere. Whatever is done out of habit is not approved; anything done in a perfunctory manner is below the level of quality expected of us. The careless song, the sermon preached for no higher reason than because it is Sunday again, the tithe tossed into the plate, the testimony given because it seems the thing to do—not one of these will stand up under the searching eyes of God. In Christian service motive is everything, for it is motive that gives to every moral act its final quality.',' Colossians 3:17',' And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.',' For the believer there is no secular/sacred dichotomy. All is sacred whether carrying out work in the office, the school, the shop, the home. We may do all to the glory of God!',' Lord, please remind me that service to You is not restricted to a church building or a church office position. I can do the menial tasks of life to Your glory though unnoticed by others.'),(448,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Four',' Faith or Superstition','52',' Magical Words and Real Faith',' Faith differs from superstition in its ground of hope. Faith rests upon character, specifically the character of God. A word is only as good as the character of the one who uttered it. Superstition counts upon a word, a text, and never thinks back of the text to the one who gave it. For the superstitious man there is a magic power in a word quite apart from the one who spoke it. The very word is magical and has only to be spoken under the right circumstances to be effective; morality or character have no place in this scheme of things. Words only count there. This in its various manifestations is a sure mark of superstition. Even in some Christian circles this ill-grounded trust in sounds and symbols is encountered all too frequently. Some believers, for instance, fear to speak the name of Jesus apart from the titles which accompany it. They dare not say <I>Jesus,</I> but must always say <I>the Lord Jesus Christ,</I> regardless of the circumstances. Obviously they believe that God is concerned with the protocol of word arrangement and will be displeased if the order is broken. Such words as amen, hallelujah, glory and others of like sacred association are repeated endlessly and meaninglessly in the apparent belief that they have in them some strange power for good. This can be no more than high-grade magic. It will pay us to search our own hearts thoroughly to discover just why we use these words.',' Acts 19:13','Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, \"In the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.\"',' The seven sons of Sceva sought to use the name of Jesus in attempting to exorcise spirits from those demon-possessed. They failed miserably because they neither knew Jesus or trusted in Him. What we believe and in whom we believe is what counts.','Lord, forgive me for using words, even Your name, as if there were some magical meaning to them. It is Your Person, who You are—Almighty God—in whom I trust and rest through Christ.'),(449,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Four',' Faith or Superstition','53',' The Great and Sovereign God','Any sound religious experience must begin with a proper conception of the nature of God. The terrible power of idolatry for evil lies in its unworthy conception of the character of the Supreme Being. Indeed it may be said without qualification that all religious experience that incorporates in itself low or ignoble ideas of God is in essence superstitious. The god of superstition is an irresponsible god, arbitrary and without character. The superstititious person must constantly try to outwit him or placate him or catch him with words and force a favor out of him. But such a person is never at peace because he is never sure of anything. His hope is fugitive and skittish. There is no trustworthy being back of his faith; there are only words. True faith does not rest upon texts alone but upon God who wrote the text. The word is an expression of the character of God and is exactly as good as that character, no more and no less. The free man in Christ has been delivered from the \"tyranny of words.\" He has gone beyond the word to God Himself and has found there his true fatherland and everlasting home. He can no longer be intimidated by the little slave-men who threaten him with punishment if he fails to repeat this religious phrase or mutter that sacred word. He has discovered the true ground of religious hope—the character of God. To such a man the Scriptures are the very words of God, meaningless apart from Him but altogether glorious when understood as the verbal expression of His holy being.',' 2 Samuel 7:22',' How great you are, O Sovereign LORD! There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.',' It is not the phonetic sound of \"God words\" or words written on paper in which we believe. It is God. Because of who He is we can trust Him, His word and His promises.',' Sovereign LORD, how great You are! There is none like You. You are God and in You I trust.'),(450,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Five',' The Logic of the Incarnation','54','Created in the Image of God','At the risk of being charged with inexcusable boldness, we venture the assertion that while the Incarnation is mysterious, it is not illogical or contrary to reason. We would not presume to settle with a pen stroke those profound and awful mysteries which have stilled the voices of the ages and brought men and angels to their knees in worship; but we would dare to say that in our opinion the act of becoming man was altogether reasonable from God\'s standpoint. It placed no strain upon the divine nature and admitted into the scheme of God nothing unnatural or inconsistent. The reasons for so believing are these: Man was originally made in the image of God. \"God created man; in the likeness of God made he him.\" This is a cardinal doctrine of the Christian faith. It is not necessary to understand all that is included in this doctrine, for even here we run into some real theological problems. But faith can soar where reason can never climb, and it is only necessary that we believe the truth. Its power over us depends upon our believing it, not upon our understanding it. The fact is all that matters: man was made in the image of God. Now, if man was made in the image of God, then God must certainly carry something of the image of man. (That sin has marred the image and introduced a foreign and destructive element into human nature does not detract from the force of the argument.) If a boy looks like his father it must surely follow that the father must look like the boy. Somewhere within man\'s nature, twisted and deformed as it may be, there is godlikeness. This will not be seriously questioned by anyone who knows his Bible. No student of Christian theology would deny this as a fact, though he might reject the conclusions we draw from the fact.',' Genesis 1:27',' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.',' The image of God in which we are created is certainly not bodily form. Image gathers up aspects of spirit (ruach/pneuma), soul (nephesh/psyche) and heart (leb/kardia). Sin has marred and distorted that image but not destroyed it. Every human being has a',' Lord, I fall so short of the potential You have provided. You have made me in Your image. Sin and self have terribly blurred and marred that image. But You give me Your Spirit that I may know You.'),(451,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Five',' The Logic of the Incarnation','55',' God in \"People\" Expression','If in the infinite condescension of God, mankind was made with a nature somewhat like its creator, then is it not reasonable that God could clothe Himself with human nature in the mystery of incarnation? and all within the framework of easy possibility without the embarrassment of uniting things unlike each other? When the ancient Word stood up in human flesh, He felt at home. He was not out of His element, for had He not heard the Father say, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\"? There was no jar, no wrench caused by the forced union of dissimilar natures. It is our humble opinion that the \"exile\" element in the earthly experience of our Lord has been greatly overplayed. That He was sad and lonely and far from home, a stranger in a strange land, is an idea that has grown up around the beautiful and the simple fact, but it is not necessarily a part of the fact. So far as we can recall there is nothing in the record to give the impression that His presence in human flesh was an unnatural or painful experience. He happily called Himself \"the Son of man,\" not an exile among men. All this is not to attempt to take away from the valid mystery that surrounds the Incarnation or to lessen the awe with which we contemplate the wonder of the Word becoming flesh to dwell among us. It is rather to clear away unauthorized notions and give the beauty of the Incarnation a chance to make its own impression upon us. That impression will be deep enough without our adding anything to it.',' John 1:14',' The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.','In Christ, God becomes \"people\" — you and me kind of people except for our sin. He exuded the glory of the Only Begotten. The eye of faith could perceive His origin and sense that He was full of grace and truth. All this in \"people\" expression.',' Father, I see in Christ living among people what You desire in my living by means of the indwelling Spirit. He produces the product of His control-the fruit of the Spirit. May that fruit characterize my life!'),(452,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Six',' Battles Are Won Before They Are Fought','56',' Persevering Strength Produced Through Trials',' The whole Bible and all past history unite to teach that battles are always won before the armies take the field. The critical moment for any army is not the day it engages the foe in actual combat; it is the day before or the month before or the year before. It is an old saying that the wars of England were won on the playing fields of Eton. The experience of hard training, tough competition and sportsmanship gained in their school years prepared the young men for real war when it came. Again that rule holds for all of us everywhere, even up on the high levels of spirital warfare. It did not take Moses long to lead the children of Israel out through the Red Sea to deliverance and freedom; but his fittedness to lead them out was the result of years of hard discipline. It took David only a few minutes to dispose of Goliath; but he had beaten the giant long before in the person of the lion and the bear. Elijah faced a sulking King Ahab and stared him down in the name of Jehovah, but we must remember that his courage to stand before kings was the result of years spent in standing before the King of kings. Christ stood silent in the presence of Pilate and for our sake went calmly out to die. He could endure the anguish of the cross because He had suffered the pains of Gethsemane the night before; there was a direct relationship between the two experiences. One served as a preparation for the other.',' James 1:2-3','Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.',' Who of us welcomes trials and counts them as pure joy? Trials hurt but they also prepare. Trials produce perseverance which leads to maturity. Want to grow in Christ? Welcome trials!',' Father, forgive me for my whining when undergoing trial and discipline. You see what is ahead and are preparing me for it. Help me to so understand what is occurring and to accept it in faith.'),(453,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Six',' Battles Are Won Before They Are Fought','57',' Discipline That Prepares Us',' The whole Bible and all past history unite to teach that battles are always won before the armies take the field. The converse of this is true also. Battles are never lost the day they are fought. They are lost the day or the year before; the results merely become manifest when the armies meet. If we were wise enough, we could predict without fail the outcome of any battle, for the law of causation determines it always. Lot fled from Sodom with the tattered remnant of his family and left all his property behind to perish in the flames, but his loss did not occur the night he escaped the burning city; it occurred the day he lifted up his eyes and saw all the well-watered plains of Jordan and coveted them. On a certain night Judas betrayed Christ with a kiss, but his tragic downfall did not take place that night; it only became evident. For months he had been undermining his own soul by filching from the meager funds entrusted to his care. He had gotten himself ready for the kind of death he died by the kind of life he had lived. His betrayal and suicide might have been accurately predicted by anyone who could have known what had been going on inside him during the days before the betrayal. Preparation is vital. Let this be noted by everyone. We can seek God today and get prepared to meet temptation tomorrow; but if we meet the enemy without first having met God, the outcome is not conjectural; the issue is already decided. We can only lose. We do well to imitate the ant who takes advantage of the summer to get ready for the winter.',' Hebrews 12:11',' No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.',' Huge victories and shattering defeats do not occur in a vacuum or in a moment of time. Rather, they are like a long burning wick of a bomb. Victories and defeats result from discipline or lack of it over a period of time which God uses to prepare us.',' You discipline me for my good, Lord, so that I may share in Your holiness. That discipline sometimes seems exceedingly hard. Yet You know what I need because You know what is coming.'),(454,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Seven',' We Need the Spirit\'s Gifts','58',' Exercising Our Gifts',' The task of the church is too great for any one person to compass and too varied for the skill of any one person to accomplish. God has met this difficulty by dividing the task and giving to every man gifts that enable him to do his part. By distributing the work, He lightens the burden for all and makes possible smooth carrying out of His purposes among men. That is undoubtedly the reason behind the gifts of the Spirit given to the various members of the Christian community. Here, as elsewhere, the manifold wisdom of God is revealed. Not all men can sing; at least not all men can sing well enough to be heard in public. Only a limited number are called to preach. Real teachers are scarce because the gift which enables a Christian to teach is not given to many. Even the humbler gifts, such as \"helps\" and \"governments,\" are given to relatively few. The gift of the evangelist is not given to all, or the pastor\'s gift or the gift of wisdom. Blessed is the man who knows his gift and who seeks to exercise it toward the other members of the body of Christ as a \"good steward of the manifold grace of God.\" A revival of true New Testament Christianity must surely bring with it a manifestation of spiritual gifts. Anything short of it will create a just suspicion that the revival is something short of scriptural.',' 1 Peter 4:10','Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God\'s grace in its various forms.',' God has gifted each of us to serve other members of the Body in particular ways. It is our responsibility, in conjunction with other body members, to identify our gifts and faithfully exercise them. The health of the church demands it!',' Father, show me the unique gifts You have given me with which to serve You and Your Church. Remind me that those gifts are from You and are to be used to build up Your Church.'),(455,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Eight',' Let\'s Deal with Life at Its Root','59',' The Inner and Eternal You','All life is at root spiritual. God is spirit, and since He is the Cause and Origin of everything, it follows that everything originally came out of spirit. Matter may indeed be only the objectification of spirit. It is interesting to learn that modern science comes pretty close to teaching just that today. It is not necessary, however, to understand the philosophical ground for this belief (if such ground exists); it is enough to believe the Scriptures, and they make it very clear that a human being is essentially a spirit clothed in a body, and that the inner life is the key to all the rest of the life. The whole Bible magnifies the inner and eternal part of man and lays correspondingly lighter emphasis upon the external and temporal. Paul sang his ringing song of victory over this world, a song he could sing with all those who \"look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal\" (2 Corinthians 4:18). Indeed it may be truthfully said that everything of lasting value in the Christian life is unseen and eternal. Things seen are of little real significance in the light of God\'s presence. He pays small attention to the beauty of a woman or the strength of a man. With Him the heart is all that matters. The rest of the life comes into notice only because it represents the dwelling place of the inner eternal being.','2 Corinthians 4:18','So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.',' Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, they are not our own. It is through our bodies that we express our spirit/soul/mind/heart. Our bodies are vehicles by which we disclose our real being.','Father, this body of mine is not externally attractive and is certainly aging, but remind me that the inner me can keep growing and become beautiful as You change me. Praise to You for eternal life in Christ and inner transformation through Him. Amen.'),(456,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Eight',' Let\'s Deal with Life at Its Root','60',' Spiritual Remedies for Spiritual Problems',' The solution to life\'s problems is spiritual because the essence of life is spiritual. It is astonishing how many difficulties clear up without any effort when the inner life gets straightened out. If half the time we spend trying to fix up outward things were spent in getting our hearts right, we would be delighted with the result. Strange as it may seem, harmony within our own hearts depends mostly upon our getting into harmony with God. Morning comes not by our pushing out the darkness but by waiting for the coming of the sun. Church difficulties are spiritual also and admit of a spiritual answer. Whatever may be wrong in the life of any church may be cleared up by recognizing the quality of the trouble and dealing with it at the root. Prayer, humility and a generous application of the Spirit of Christ will cure just about any disease in the body of believers. Yet this is usually the last thing we think about when difficulties arise. We often attempt to cure spiritual ills with carnal medicines, and the results are more than disappointing.',' Colossians 1:9',' For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.','Sedatives and band-aids do not deal with the causes of physical problems. How often we try to solve spiritual problems with non-spiritual remedies. Out of close fellowship with God comes love and humility—the remedy for most church problems.',' Lord, to our church leaders, to all of us believers, give knowledge of Your will through spiritual wisdom and understanding. And may we soak our problems in prayer. In Jesus\' name.'),(457,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Nine',' Faith Is a Continuous Act','61',' Present Tense Believing','The book of Acts lays strong emphasis upon steadfastness in the faith, as do the Pauline epistles and the Book of Hebrews. Obviously the apostles conceived the Christian life to be a long tough journey, requiring a lot of faith and determination but ending in glory at last. Neither Christ nor His apostles taught the once-for-all finality of the act of believing so popular among us today. The whole build-up of the usual evangelistic meeting these days is toward the initial act of believing. Once a confession has been extracted from the seeker, a sense of victory seizes on everybody. It is as if a fish had been landed and safely stowed into the basket. The saving act has been performed, and there remains nothing more to be done. Not so taught the apostles or the faithful leaders of the church of God through the centuries. Faith in Christ is not an act to be done and gotten over with as one might get inoculated against yellow fever or cholera. The repentant sinner\'s first act of believing in Christ for forgiveness and eternal life is the beginning of a continuous act of believing which lasts throughout life and for all eternity. \"Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed.\" These words accord perfectly with the exhortations of Barnabas to the Christians at Pisidia and Antioch: \"That with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord . . . confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.\"',' Colossians 1:22-23a','But now he has reconciled you by Christ\'s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation—if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel.',' Believing is present tense. It is good to have believed yesterday. Of greater significance is believing today whether going through sunshine or darkness, mountain tops or valleys. Believing today prepares us to keep believing tomorrow.',' Lord, I cling to You today. I may be stumbling and blundering but in faith I hold on to You. I choose to believe. Help me when my faith is weak. For Jesus\' sake.'),(458,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Twenty-Nine',' Faith Is a Continuous Act','62',' Continuing the Journey',' We have heard of some churches that hold a service very early Sunday morning so the worshipers can get their religious duties over before going out to play golf the rest of the day. It gives them a comfortable feeling to know that their responsibilities toward God have been discharged with a minimum of inconvenience and without hindering in any way the fun of the day. We would be tempted to smile at this if we did not notice an uncomfortable parallel between that practice and the practice of getting our believing done early so that we might be free thereafter to walk as men. The insurance policy aspect of salvation is very prominent in our times. We pay it up in advance (or allow the Lord to pay it) and from there on we rest in an accomplished fact. The urge to go on is almost wholly absent. This is not good, and it is surely not scriptural. True faith is not an end; it is a means to an end. It is not a destination; it is a journey, and the initial act of believing in Christ is a gate leading into the long lane we are to travel with Christ for the rest of our earthly days. That journey is hard and tired, but it is wonderful also, and no one ever regretted the weariness when he came to the end of the road.',' 2 Corinthians 5:7',' We live [walk] by faith, not by sight.',' It is by faith we walk and keep on walking. If we sit down, simply stand or fall without getting up, we are not walking. Make progress in your journey of faith today!','Thank You, Lord, I do not walk alone. You are with me. You lead me. By faith I recognize Your presence and follow You.'),(459,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty',' Deeds are Seeds','63',' Deed Seeds',' Every man sows what he will later reap and reaps what he has previously sown. This is a law of life, says Paul, and we may as well know that we cannot beat it. God will not be mocked. We are all sowing our own future, and the seeds we sow are the deeds we do. And, ironically enough, sometimes deeds we neglect to do or are afraid to do become seeds also and bring forth their harvest. For in the total scheme of things it often happens that deeds undone have as great power for good or evil as deeds actually performed. The unbreakable link between harvest and seed was forged by the Lord God Himself at the creation. From Him went forth the word, \"after his kind,\" and that word has linked together the seed and the harvest, the sowing and the reaping, from that day to this. Our today is bound to all our yesterdays, and our tomorrow will be the sum of our present and our past. That is the fact, and we may make of it what we will. The sovereign God has permitted us to have a measure of conditional sovereignty, a mark of the divine image once given at the Creation and partially lost by the Fall.',' Galatians 6:7',' Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.','Today presents unique opportunity—deeds to be done and deeds not to be done. There will be deeds performed. Will they be the right ones or the wrong ones? The closeness of our walk with God and our appropriation of His enablement are the determinants.',' Lord, help me to make this day special by doing what You want me to do and not doing what is not Your will.'),(460,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty',' Deeds are Seeds','64',' What We Reap Depends On What We Sow','We may sow to the flesh if we will. There will be no interference from above. Thus to sow is our privilege—if we want to reap the harvest of corruption which must inevitably follow, a harvest no man in his right mind could deliberately choose. No, the snare lies in choosing the pleasures of sowing with the secret hope that in some way we can escape the sorrows of the reaping; but never since the beginning of the world has it been possible to separate the one from the other. The way to deal with a law of God is to work along with it. By faith and obedience we can put every divine law to work for us. And the law of sowing and reaping may be brought to our service and made to toil for our everlasting good. So kind is God and so thoughtful of His creatures. \"He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.\" There it is, and we have but to submit to it to gain from it an everlasting reward. Deeds done in the Spirit, in obedience to Christ and with the purpose of bringing honor to the Triune God, are seeds of endless blessedness. The first gift of life is not by works, but by faith in the work of a sufficient Redeemer; but after the miracle of the new birth has been accomplished, the Christian to a large extent carrries his future in his hands. If he denies himself and takes up his cross in meek obedience, his deeds will become seeds of life and everlasting glory. He may forget his deeds of love or think them small and useless, but God is not unmindful. He never forgets. The sweet harvest of a life well lived will be there to meet the sower after the toil is ended and the heat of the day is past.',' Galatians 6:8-9','The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.',' The harvest (not our salvation!) depends on the seed we sow. We can only reap tomorrow what we sow today. What kind of seed are we sowing?',' You have shown me, Lord, that good seed is doing good to all people. It\'s not enough to hold the seed, contemplate it. Good seed has to be sown. May I sow much good seed. For Jesus\' sake.'),(461,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-One',' Shadows versus Reality','65',' Beyond the Shadows',' \"Behold, Thy servant,\" confessed Augustine concerning one period in his life; \"behold, Thy servant, fleeing from his Lord, and obtaining a shadow.\" \"God is stupendously rich Reality,\" wrote von Hugel 1,500 years later, \"the alone boundlessly rich Reality.\" These sentences agree with and explain each other, and both accord with the teaching of Scripture and the facts of the creation. God is the only absolute Reality; all other reality is relative and contingent. While the things we know and experience day by day are real, they are not real in themselves but only as God gives them existence. They could not continue to be should God withdraw His constant word of creation and leave them to themselves for even one short moment. Here then is the rational ground for the Christian\'s insistence that God must be everything to us, that we must hold nothing dear except God. All other things are to be seen in relation to God and valued only as they are held in God and for God. All things are but shadows cast by the great Reality, God, and if we were to gain the whole world and miss God, we should have no more than a handful of shadows.',' John 7:37','On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, \"If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.\"',' Our attention may be fixed on the shadows rather than the God-Reality; on the gifts rather than the Giver; the blessings rather than the Blessor. Let\'s fix our heart-eyes on God!',' Lord, so often my attention is fixed on blessings, good feelings; wanting life to run smoothly, comfortably. I look to You. I want to draw near to You, to know You.'),(462,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-One',' Shadows versus Reality','66',' Stepping Out of the Shadows','All things are but shadows cast by the great Reality, God, and if we were to gain the whole world and miss God, we should have no more than a handful of shadows. With this great eternal truth before His mind—the absolute reality of God as the central fact of existence—Christ taught the necessity of separation from the world and of complete consecration to God as the only way to escape the shadows and obtain those riches that cannot pass away. The modern Christian who insists upon separation as a condition of true spirituality is not the old-fashioned narrow person he is currently declared to be. His religious philosophy is altogether sound and wholly in accord with the total sum of things in heaven and earth. God being who and what He is and things being what they are, complete consecration is the only way to peace for any of us. The drift among Christians today is definitely away from this truth. More and more, our religious leaders are coming to place confidence in shadows and are teaching others to do the same. And just so far as shadows are accepted as real, the one great Reality is ignored. It is hard to think how a greater tragedy could possibly come upon us.',' Luke 9:23-24','Then he said to them all: \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.\"',' One day we will step on heaven\'s shore into the full glory of God-Reality. Will we then discover that here on earth we spent most of our life in the shadows, in cultural Christianity, when we could have embraced the reality of God?',' O Lord, how often I forget that in this world system I am an alien. I want to know You, to follow You. That means taking up my cross daily. May I do it even if few around me understand.'),(463,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Two',' To the Spirit-filled Man Everything Is Spiritual','67',' Being Holy In All We Do',' It is the privilege of every Christian to live so fully in God that he never gets out of the experienced Presence for one moment. When we have so learned to live in God and to experience His continual Presence, everything in our lives becomes spiritually significant. The old dividing line between the spiritual and the secular is removed, and every act becomes spiritual. What before had seemed mundane and nonspiritual now shines with a new light. God is found to be inhabiting our simplest acts as surely as our most lofty ones. All of life becomes good and acceptable to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. A life lived in Christ becomes in the true sense a life of unceasing prayer. The whole life becomes a prayer: words are verbal prayers, thoughts become mental prayers, deeds become prayers in action and even sleep may be but unconscious prayer. Psychology acknowledges a deep-down stratum of the mind which it calls the subconscious. It is that part which is in control during sleep and while we are under the power of an anesthetic. It may be the part of us that receives spiritual impressions first, becoming consciously aware of them only after they have first been received and registered in that mysterious depth of the mind which lies immediately below consciousness. Whether or not that is the correct explanation for things, it is still true that the whole mind may be placed so fully under the control of Christ that even sleep and forgetfulness work on our side to bless and help us in our practical waking lives. Whatever the explanation, the fact is known to every Spirit-filled Christian. We are only trying to state the familiar truth in less familiar language.',' 1 Peter 1:15-16','But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written: \"Be holy, because I am holy.\"','\"Be holy in all you do.\" When we open to the Holy Spirit everything—all rooms of our heart, all the closets, the crevices—everything, those secular/sacred compartmental dividers disappear. We allow the Spirit control of everything!',' O Spirit of God, I throw open to You my whole heart and life. Change me. Change my thinking. Wholly cleanse. Fill me!'),(464,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Three',' Let\'s Be Careful How We Use the Scriptures','68',' Seeing God through the Window of the Scriptures',' There is a naive assumption on the part of many that the Bible has about it some kind of magic power for good, so that merely to read it or quote it is profitable, regardless of the circumstances. This idea needs to be corrected. Peter suggested that the writings of Paul might not always be profitable to everyone. \". . . Even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction\" (2 Peter 3:15-16). There is a danger that the Word of God may become an opaque veil to hide God from us, and without doubt it sometimes is just that. The Scripture should be like the atmosphere, a transparent medium through which we look at the sun. When the atmosphere above us stops the light and allows us to see it instead of seeing through it, then its proper function is destroyed. So it is with the Word of God. When we so read the Bible as to make it an end rather than a medium through which we penetrate to the divine Person of God, it is no longer doing its proper work in us. Or otherwise stated, the Bible is a telescope through which we look at the \"land that is very far off.\" When we become content with the telescope, it must surely fail us, for God never meant an instrument to take the place that belongs to Him alone; He never intended that a Book should substitute for the Living Word. The threefold purpose of the Bible is to inform, to inspire faith and to secure obedience. Whenever it is used for any other purpose, it is used wrongly and may do actual injury. The Holy Scriptures will do us good only as we present an open mind to be taught, a tender heart to believe and a surrendered will to obey. If we do these things, then the written Word will surely become to us a transparent lens through which we may gaze upon the Triune God. And so to gaze in faith is to experience a bit of heaven here below.',' Luke 24:45',' Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.','The Scriptures are a window through which to see God; an amplifier by which to hear His voice. Essential in \"inscripturization\" was the ministry of the Holy Spirit. His ministry continues to be essential in opening our minds to understand the Scriptures.',' Open my eyes to see, my ears to hear, my mind to understand. I want to see You, to discern Your voice, to live in the enablement You give. In Jesus\' name.'),(465,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Three',' We Are What We Are Anyway','69',' Handling Criticism','\"Let not thy peace depend on the tongues of men,\" said the wise old Christian mystic, Thomas à Kempis; \"for whether they judge well or ill, thou art not on that account other than thyself.\" The desire to stand well with our fellow men is a natural one, and quite harmless up to a point, but when that desire becomes so all-consuming that we cannot be happy apart from the praises of men, it is no longer harmless, it is sinful in itself and injurious in its effects. One of the first things a Christian should get used to is abuse. The sweetest soul ever to live in this world was subjected to an ever-increasing barrage of vile calumny during His walk among men; and if they so used the Master of the house, how can the servants hope to escape? The only way to avoid evil tongues is to withdraw entirely from the society of men; and even then there might be those who would raise a meaningful eyebrow and suggest that perhaps after all we may have a pretty good reason for getting under cover! To do nothing is to get abused for laziness, and to do anything is to get abused for not doing something else.',' 1 Corinthians 4:4',' My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.',' How vulnerable we are to the criticism of others, particularly those whom we respect. There is the danger that we listen more closely to the praise and criticism of others than to God. It is God whom we serve today and tomorrow.',' Lord, You know that I do and say much that is deserving of criticism. May I change where You show me and may I follow Your will even when others do not understand.'),(466,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Three',' We Are What We Are Anyway','70',' God is Our Critic',' Was it not Voltaire who said that some people were like insects, they would never be noticed except that they sting? A traveler must make up his mind to go on regardless of the insects that make his trip miserable. They cannot stop a determined man; they can only make his journey unpleasant. So it is with the people who delight to swarm around the ears of God\'s servants as they move onward toward their appointed goal. We may all expect to be stung by our many fellow humans who appear to have dedicated themselves to the task of causing minor heartaches wherever they can as long as they can to as many people as possible. These misguided people cannot be escaped, they can only be endured. One thing is certain, a Christian\'s standing before God does not depend upon his standing before men. A high reputation does not make a man dearer to God, nor does the tongue of the slanderer influence God\'s attitude toward His people in any way. He knows us each one, and we stand or fall in the light of His perfect knowledge. Let us be sure that we are right with God and with men; after that there is nothing we can do except to \"both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.\" And by the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit, we may do our hoping and waiting in such a way that our enemies will be forced to admit that we have been with Jesus and learned of Him.',' Romans 14:10',' You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God\'s judgment seat.',' It is to God we are responsible. We can sometimes learn from our critics. But we serve God. He is our judge. Remembering that can help us to go on despite criticism and also save us from becoming critics of others.',' Forgive me, Lord, for judging my brothers and sisters. And forgive them for unjustly judging me. Help me to discern the difference between evil criticism and that which is for my good.'),(467,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Five',' God Can\'t Help Loving','71',' Never-ending Love',' Meister Eckhart said that God must love if He is to remain God. Were He to stop loving us He would lose His Godhead. Such expressions as \"if God is to remain God\" and all others like them are in one sense ridiculous, for God can never cease to be God, nor can He lose anything that is Himself. The human mind, however, in its struggle to understand the impenetrable mysteries that surround the Person of God, is forced to think according to its own laws and to express itself in language that is in itself inaccurate, but which nevertheless represents an honest effort of the human heart to grasp the inconceivable. In saying that God must love us if He is to remain God, we are simply thinking human thoughts about God. It is the effort of the finite to contain the infinite, and while the thoughts are short of the mark, they are the best we are able to produce, we being what we are. Eckhart was right in saying that God must love us. God being what He is, He has no choice. His love falls upon everything and everyone as the sun\'s rays light upon all the ten thousand objects on the face of the earth. The sun has no choice; it must shine on, whether it is shining upon a beautiful forest or a rubbish heap. The object upon which it shines has nothing to do with its shining. It shines because it is the sun. God is love, so His loving is not something He may do nor not do at His will. Loving us is not an intermittent act or series of acts which God does in between other acts. His love flows steadily out upon the whole human race in an unbroken and continuous fullness. There is not a time, not a fraction of time, when God\'s love is not active toward us. It is as constant as the being of God, for it is the being of God in unforced, normal expression.',' 1 John 4:8',' Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.',' God is love. He eternally loves others. \"Love is the being of God in unforced, normal expression.\" What release to know that God does not stop loving me when I fail Him. His love is as eternal as He is, because God is love.',' O God, I will never understand the quality, the depth, the eternalness of Your love. But thank You, thank You. You love me!'),(468,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Five',' God Can\'t Help Loving','72',' Love the Cause of Redemption',' Everything that God does is done without effort or strain. He does all his acts with equal ease and tranquillity. We are often tempted to wonder how God could love us, but honest as this feeling is, it is nevertheless the result of a wrong way of looking at things. God does not love us because we are hard or easy to love; He loves us because He is God, not because we are good or bad or more attractive or less so. God\'s love is not drawn out of Him by its object; it flows out from God in a steady stream because He is love. \"God so loved the world,\" not because the world was lovable but because God is love. Christ did not die for us that God might love us; He died for us because God already loved us from everlasting. Love is not the result of redemption; it is the cause of it. One question may demand to be answered: Does God love some people more than others? If not, what was meant by calling John \"the disciple Jesus loved,\" as if to say that He loved John more than the rest? The answer is simple. John was more responsive to the love of Christ and could receive and enjoy it to a greater fullness. The divine love could operate toward this loving man with a joyous freedom not possible with others who had not his simplicity and faith. The sunflower that turns its face to the sky all day long gets more sun than the violet that hides among the leaves. But the same sun shines in fullness upon both. God has no favorites, except as some of His children by their loving response make it possible for Him to shower more love upon them.',' John 3:16',' For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.',' God loves us because He is God. He does not love some of us more or less than others. He loves each one. Out of His love He has provided redemption. Are we running to His love or running from it?',' Father, You so love me that You gave Christ for me. He so loved me that He paid the penalty of my sin by dying for me. In thanks and worship I bow before You.'),(469,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Six',' Jesus Is Victor!','73','Living By Faith In the Victor','The two major elements present in the Easter story are the fact and the meaning of the fact. That Christ arose after He had been put to death by crucifixion is the fact; the true historicity of the event is too well established to require proof or even comment today. The meaning of that resurrection, however, must be rediscovered by each believing soul and by the church age after age till our Lord returns to earth again. One meaning attached to the resurrection is that Christ has conquered the enemies of mankind and guaranteed the final triumph of all true believers over every power of the devil. For the rescue of the lost race was effected only after a fight. Let us not allow our poetic imagination to run away with us. Easter is more than sunshine and lilies. It signifies the appearance again of our David who went into the field to meet the Goliath of sin and death in mortal combat. Christ came back to assure us that the victory had been won. Death and the devil had been done in by the only One who was capable of such a mighty act, Jesus the Son of God. An old hymn states this for us in ecstatic language: The strife is o\'er, the battle done; The victory of life is won; The Song of triumph has begun — Hallelujah! The powers of death have done their worst, But Christ their legions hath dispersed; Let shouts of holy joy outburst — Hallelujah! He brake the age-bound chains of hell; The bars from heaven\'s high portals fell; Let hymns of praise His triumph tell: Hallelujah!',' 1 Corinthians 15:56-57','The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.','Not only has Christ won the victory over sin, death and Satan, we may share in that victory. We can\'t win it ourselves but we can participate in it by faith identification with the Victor.','Thank You, Father, for victory through the Lord Jesus Christ. I stand with Christ in His victory.'),(470,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Six',' Jesus Is Victor!','74','Alive in Christ','We might well spend the rest of the year reverently inquiring into the meanings of the resurrection. And probably the best method to pursue is to search for those meanings that touch us as individual Christians here and now. It is, of course, necessary to preserve the theology of the resurrection and to guard the truth well and carefully; but that is not enough. We must know what it means to us as pilgrims and strangers. That He \"rose again the third day according to the Scriptures\" is the biblical foundation for our faith in a risen Lord. But love and faith would go further; they would devoutly seek to experience the present riches of His Easter triumph. Jesus is Victor! That is the truth His resurrection proclaims. Now it remains for us to allow Him to be Victor in us, thus multiplying the glory of His triumph in the hearts of His trusting people.','Romans 6:11','In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.','Are we living in the shadows of Friday and Saturday or in the triumph of Easter Sunday resurrection? Too often we live as if unrelated to the Risen Christ rather counting ourselves dead to sin and alive to God.','Your death and resurrection, Lord, I see as not merely historical events of the past. Thank You that through faith in You I may experience the effects of those events in daily life.'),(471,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Seven',' The \"Ground of the Soul\"','75','The Gift of Divine Power','It is the teaching of Meister Eckhart that there is something far inside the mysterious depths of a human life which is unknown except as God and the individual know it. This he called the \"ground\" of the soul. This \"ground\" is, according to Eckhart, the stuff which once received the image of God at creation. The lesser powers of the soul are the instruments through which this mysterious primal stuff makes itself felt in the world. These powers are imagination, reason, the faculty of speech and the creative powers which appear at full bloom in the artist and the poet and in varying degrees of brilliance in the commonality of mankind. In this far-in secret sanctuary, God reveals Himself to the individual as a \"birth,\" bringing forth a new creation by the regenerating act of the Holy Spirit. Thus we receive from Christ the very nature of God (2 Peter 1:4) and are spiritually prepared for the full revelation of Christ in us, the hope of glory. This would seem to be but a slightly different way of stating the truths taught by Paul in his inspired epistles. The apostle used the language of theology, or better still, he used the language of the Bible, but what he taught was not different from that taught by the man Eckhart. This great mystic theologian thought in terms of the psychology of his times, but when we make allowance for the difference of approach, the substance is the same. And a thoroughly Christian heart will understand the language of both.',' 2 Peter 1:3-4','His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate.',' God equips us for high level living. His divine power enables us to participate in the divine nature. Why, then, do we live as spiritual paupers?',' Lord, I want to soar as an eagle into the heights of spiritual reality. Show me what it means to participate in the divine nature. For Jesus\' sake.'),(472,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Seven',' The \"Ground of the Soul\"','76','That Fragrance of the Rose of Sharon','The Holy Spirit never differs from Himself, and wherever He touches a human mind His sure marks are always present so plainly that there can be no mistaking them. Anyone familiar with the work of the French artist Millet will notice a similarity in everything he painted, as if the very breathing personality of the man had somehow gotten into the paint and onto the canvas. So the Holy Spirit teaches the same thing to everyone; however different the subjects may be from each other, the fine touch of the Spirit\'s hand may be detected on each one. For this reason, Christian devotional books are very much alike no matter who may have written them or how widely divergent may have been the religious views of the authors. The masters of the inner life may at first appear to be far apart in some of their theological positions, but before he has read long, the delighted reader will discover the likenesses in the spirit of their teachings. They are talking about the same thing in their several ways and are as alike as various paintings by the same artist. The fragrance of the Rose of Sharon lingers over their pages; one face looks forth from the lattice and one voice is heard in the garden. Because this is true, Eckhart\'s doctrine of \"the ground of the soul\" will be recognized as an old friend by the Spirit-taught Christian even though he had never before heard of Eckhart. He will find himself in familiar surroundings because he has walked there himself at other times and in different company.','John 10:14','I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me.','We recognize brothers and sisters in Christ even when they speak a different theological and experiential language. As we draw near we perceive their love for Christ, their family likeness, the fragrance of the Rose of Sharon.','Beyond what seems correct theological language and form, Lord, may there exude from me the fragrance of Your presence.'),(473,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Seven',' The \"Ground of the Soul\"','77','The Inner Chamber of Humankind','However we may explain this mysterious \"ground\" within us, we will not have been long in the Christian way until we begin to experience it. We will find that we have within us a secret garden where no one can enter except ourself and God. Not only does no one else enter, no one else can enter. This secret inner chamber is the sacred trysting place for Christ and the believing soul; no one among all our dearest friends has the open sesame that will permit him to enter there. If God is shut out, then there can be only everlasting loneliness and numb despair. Where God is not known in the inner shrine, the individual must try to compensate for his sense of aloneness in whatever way he can. Most persons run away to the world to find companionship and surround themselves with every kind of diversionary activity. All devices for killing time, every shallow scheme for entertainment, are born out of this inner loneliness. It is a significant and revealing fact that such things have in these last days grown into billion dollar enterprises! So much will men pay to forget that they are a temple without a God, a garden where no voice is heard in the cool of the day. The better minds among us, goaded by this subconscious loneliness, may, as Schopenhauer, become philosophers of despair or, as Byron and Hardy, poets of desperation and hopelessness. But no matter how brilliant the intellect, the lonely heart can never know peace. Until we find God through Christ, that inner \"ground\" will remain a kind of eternal thirst inside of us, and its voice, where that voice is recognized, will be a plea, an accusation, a thin plaintive cry deep within us asking for eternal life and restoration and God.','Romans 8:16','The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God\'s children.','That inner chamber of our being is our spirit. It is with our spirit that the Holy Spirit communes. He assures us that we are God\'s children. He witnesses to us of Christ and eternal realities.','You stoop to commune with me, O God. Your Spirit bears witness with my spirit that I am Your child. Thank You for that holy communion.'),(474,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Eight',' Driving with Our Brakes On','78','Circumstantial Friction','Many Christians live like a man driving with his brakes on. It is, of course, friction that retards the car\'s progress, for all brakes work by friction. The car is temporarily at odds with itself; one surface wants to revolve and another surface in contact with it wants to stand still. This clash of purposes sets up friction; and friction always wins at last. Nothing can continue to move if it is opposed by enough friction. Even the most perfectly operated car cannot escape some resistance to its forward motion. There will always be gravity, air pressure and the unavoidable pressures of working parts that will tend to slow it down. But these are figured in and overcome by the steady application of energy to the wheels. It\'s the brakes that give a car a hard time. Now all this would seem to be a parable of some kind. The Christian need not expect to escape opposition. As long as Satan stands to resist the sons of God, as long as the world and the flesh remain, the believing man will meet opposition. Sometimes it will be sharp and obvious, but mostly it will be just the hidden and unsuspected friction set up by circumstances. No one need be anxious about this, however, for God has figured it in and made allowance for it. That kind of friction does little real harm. It will not retard progress much, and the very necessity of overcoming opposition will but add strength to the Christian\'s moral muscles.','Philippians 4:6','Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.','There are circumstances that we feel we can control yet fail to do so. Then there are the circumstances beyond our control. It is that circumstantial friction that slows spiritual progress, causes us to veer off the path or detracts our attention from th','Forgive me, Father, for falling into anxiety when You invite me to throw all my cares on You.'),(475,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Eight',' Driving with Our Brakes On','79',' Inward Friction',' But there is another kind of friction which retards spiritual progress and does real injury to the soul. It is the friction created by inward maladjustment. Our Lord had this in mind when He spoke of the value of the \"single eye,\" and James referred to the same thing when he told of the wavering man of double mind who was unstable in all his ways. While the heart is at cross-purposes with itself, there can be no inward harmony, only discord and carnal heat that slowly wear out the life. One source of friction is resentfulness. To hold bad feeling against another is to put the brakes on; no matter how sincerely we desire to go on in the holy way, we are held back by the grinding of resentment within us. Morally resentment is static and will brake to a stop any soul that will harbor it. It is vitally important to remove the pressure that is checking forward motion. This we can do by forgiving our enemies and taking pardon and cleansing from the Lord. To name all the possible causes of inward friction would be to list the works of the flesh in their entirety. The flesh warreth against the spirit: that is, it seeks to stop the motions of the growing heart and bring it to a standstill. Or, failing that, it will put as much pressure as possible on the life and slow its progress as much as it can. The sad thing is that so many of us seem willing to let things go on that way. We \"grovel here below,\" creeping forward painfully and at a snail\'s pace, when we might be racing unhindered toward the prize. Let\'s check up on ourselves. Possibly we may need to take the brakes off.',' Ephesians 4:32',' Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.',' Resentment and unforgiveness can eat away at love and peace. The solution is simple enough. Forgive others as Christ has forgiven you.',' Lord, help me run the race with the brakes off. By your Spirit highlight those areas of life where I am yielding to the flesh rather than to You.'),(476,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Nine',' Three Ways to Get What We Want','80','Censoring Our Desires In the Will of God','The word wish in its modern sense has little or no place in the Christian\'s vocabulary. The word occurs rarely in the Bible, and when it does it seldom means more than to will or desire. It is hard to conceive of anything more completely futile than wishing. It is significant that wishing is done mostly by children and superstitious people. However sweet and innocent it may appear to see a child going through his little ritual of wishing, it can become something far from harmless when carried over into adult life. And even the child should be taught very early that wishing gets him nowhere. The evil of the empty wish lies in the fact that the wisher is not adjusted to the will of God. He allows his desires to play over things that are entirely out of God\'s will for him and dreams of possessing what he well knows he should not have. Five minutes of this futile dreaming and he has lost the fine edge off his spiritual life. Should the act ripen into a habit, his Christian life may be seriously injured. The man soon comes to substitute mere longing for hard work, and unless he corrects his fault sharply, he will degenerate into a spineless dreamer of empty dreams. Every desire should be brought to the test of God\'s will. If the desire is out of the will of God, it should be instantly dismissed as unworthy of us. To continue to long for something that is plainly out of the will of God for us is to prove how unreal our consecration actually is.','1 John 5:14-15','This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us-whatever we ask-we know that we have what we asked of him.','God invites us to petition Him boldly, assuring us that He hears us and will grant our requests. However, those petitions are to accord with His will. In some areas His will is crystal clear; in others somewhat unclear. Are our prayers according to His w','Lord, I\'m sometimes guilty of asking what I know is not Your will for me. Forgive me. Your will be done in my life as it is in heaven!'),(477,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Nine',' Three Ways to Get What We Want','81','Praying for the \"Impossible\" that God Wills for Us','Every desire should be brought to the test of God\'s will. If the desire is out of the will of God, it should be instantly dismissed as unworthy of us. To continue to long for something that is plainly out of the will of God for us is to prove how unreal our consecration actually is. If, however, the desired object is legimate and innocent, then there are three possible ways by which it may be obtained: one is to work for it, another is to pray for it and a third is to work and pray for it. These are clear methods by which God gives His good gifts to His people. They are not to be confused with each other and may be distinguished in practical living. Some things are altogether out of the sphere of possibility for us, and yet altogether within God\'s gracious will for us. What to do? Prayer is the immediate answer. God has planned that we should go to Him for impossibilities when those impossibilities are a part of His eternal will for our highest good. Under such circumstances we should press our petitions upon Him with all the boldness and ardor of an obedient and trusting child. God loves such praying and has given every reason for us to believe that He will hear our prayer and in due time send the answer.',' Matthew 7:7-8','Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.','Ask, seek and knock. God delights in answering our prayer, especially those things we view as \"impossible.\" But it is for us to ask, seek and knock. He may answer quickly or after many years. Or He may simply and clearly say \"no.\"','Lord, I\'m sometimes impatient in prayer and sometimes I even give up. Forgive me. You know how best to answer my prayer and when. Thank You that You delight in granting the impossible.'),(478,'The Next Chapter after the Last',' Thirty-Nine',' Three Ways to Get What We Want','82','Work and Pray','It is useless to ask God for something we could obtain with a bit of effort properly directed. No instructed Christian will waste his time praying for things that are within his own power to obtain. To do so is to deceive ourselves and make a farce of the whole concept of prayer. If work will get it for us, then work it is or we can go without it. God will not contribute to our delinquency by supplying us with gifts which we could get for ourselves but have done nothing to obtain. But there is a third category consisting of desired objects which work alone can never secure. They lie far enough out of our reach that it will take something supernatural to get them for us, yet near enough that we must labor to obtain them. This adds up to work and prayer, and it will probably be found that the greatest majority of desired objects and objectives fall within this category. And this situation brings us close to God and makes us His co-laborers. Whether it be a desire to open a closed field, win a hostile tribe, obtain a better job, build a new church, have a successful meeting, rear a family, get through school or do any one of an almost infinite number of legitimate things, the method is likely to be the twofold one of work and prayer. We might paraphrase the famous exhortation of Dr. Simpson and say that when faced with these borderline tasks which we must work at but which we can never do alone, the thing to do is to work as if we had it all to do and pray as if we expected God to do it all. But wishing-let the vain dreamers and the builders of Spanish castles spend their time at it if they will. We know better than to waste our time and efforts at anything so useless.','Acts 16:10, 14','After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. . . . One of those listening was a woman named Lydia . . . The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul\'s message.','Paul would never have experienced the demonstration of God\'s power in Philippi had he not obeyed God and gone there. Yet Paul could not open Lydia\'s heart to respond to the message. Only God could do that. There is that for us to do and that for God to do.','O Lord, give me sensitivity to Your direction as to what You want me to do and what only You can do. In Jesus\' name.'),(479,'That Incredible Christian',' One',' That Incredible Christian','1','The Cross Message: Foolishness or the Power of God?','The cross stands in bold opposition to the natural man. Its philosophy runs contrary to the processes of the unregenerate mind, so that Paul could say bluntly that the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness. To try to find a common ground between the message of the cross and man\'s fallen reason is to try the impossible, and if persisted in must result in an impaired reason, a meaningless cross and a powerless Christianity. But let us bring the whole matter down from the uplands of theory and simply observe the true Christian as he puts into practice the teachings of Christ and His apostles. Note the contradictions: The Christian believes that in Christ he has died, yet he is more alive than before and he fully expects to live forever. He walks on earth while seated in heaven and though born on earth he finds that after his conversion he is not at home here. Like the nighthawk, which in the air is the essence of grace and beauty but on the ground is awkward and ugly, so the Christian appears at his best in the heavenly places but does not fit well into the ways of the very society into which he was born.','1 Corinthians 1:18','For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.','The message of the Cross—Christ dying for sinners—is perceived so differently. It is foolishness to those who are perishing. It is the power of God to those who are being saved.

That he may be safe he puts himself in jeopardy; he loses his life to save it and is in danger of losing it if he attempts to preserve it. He goes down to get up. If he refuses to go down he is already down, but when he starts down he is on his way up. He is strongest when he is weakest and weakest when he is strong. Though poor he has the power to make others rich, but when he becomes rich his ability to enrich others vanishes. He has most after he has given most away and has least when he possesses most. He may be and often is highest when he feels lowest and most sinless when he is most conscious of sin. He is wisest when he knows that he knows not and knows least when he has acquired the greatest amount of knowledge. He sometimes does most by doing nothing and goes furthest when standing still. In heaviness he manages to rejoice and keeps his heart glad even in sorrow.','1 Corinthians 3:18-19','Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a \'fool\' so that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God\'s sight.','Strong when weak and weak when strong! To embrace that truth — not just in mind but in heart and life expression — is to take a giant leap in spiritual maturity!','Lord, Your pattern of life for me is antithetical to that of this world. But it is in You I live. Deliver me from the enemy\'s deception that I may see clearly Your way and follow it. In Jesus\' name.'),(481,'That Incredible Christian',' One',' That Incredible Christian','3',' Paradox Living',' The paradoxical character of the Christian is revealed constantly. For instance, he believes that he is saved now, nevertheless he expects to be saved later and looks forward joyfully to future salvation. He fears God but is not afraid of Him. In God\'s presence he feels overwhelmed and undone, yet there is nowhere he would rather be than in that presence. He knows that he has been cleansed from his sin, yet he is painfully conscious that in his flesh dwells no good thing. He loves supremely One whom he has never seen, and though himself poor and lowly he talks familiarly with One who is King of all kings and Lord of all lords, and is aware of no incongruity in so doing. He feels that he is in his own right altogether less than nothing, yet he believes without question that he is the apple of God\'s eye and that for him the Eternal Son became flesh and died on the cross of shame. The Christian is a citizen of heaven and to that sacred citizenship he acknowledges first allegiance; yet he may love his earthly country with that intensity of devotion that caused John Knox to pray \"O God, give me Scotland or I die.\"',' 1 Peter 1:8-9',' Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.',' Living in the paradox with our faith eyes fixed on the unseen. We are aliens surrounded by the ultimately unreal. We are pilgrims on our way home. In it all He is real and we are really His.',' O God, my faith is fixed on You. I am Your child. You are my Father. With my hand in Yours I walk through the paradox of life.'),(482,'That Incredible Christian',' One',' That Incredible Christian','4','Living Now in Light of the Not Yet','The Christian is a citizen of heaven and to that sacred citizenship he acknowledges first allegiance . . . He cheerfully expects before long to enter that bright world above, but he is in no hurry to leave this world and is quite willing to await the summons of his Heavenly Father. And he is unable to understand why the critical unbeliever should condemn him for this; it all seems so natural and right in the circumstances that he sees nothing inconsistent about it. The cross-carrying Christian, furthermore, is both a confirmed pessimist and an optimist the like of which is to be found nowhere else on earth. When he looks at the cross he is a pessimist, for he knows that the same judgment that fell on the Lord of glory condemns in that one act all nature and all the world of men. He rejects every human hope out of Christ because he knows that man\'s noblest effort is only dust building on dust. Yet he is calmly, restfully optimistic. If the cross condemns the world the resurrection of Christ guarantees the ultimate triumph of good throughout the universe. Through Christ all will be well at last and the Christian waits the consummation. Incredible Christian!','1 John 3:2-3','Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.','We shall be like Him! That seems altogether impossible to those who know us now and to ourselves. But we are in the process of transformation. Complete fulfillment of His promises are still in the future but in the light of those promises we can live now.','Father, I see darkness all around me but you provide a laser beam that leads to home. May that beam of light reflect through my life to those about me. May You shine through me!'),(483,'That Incredible Christian',' Two',' Time Cannot Help Us','5',' Time as Environment not Sanctifier',' Sin has done frightful things to us and its effect upon us is all the more deadly because we were born in it and are scarcely aware of what is happening to us. One false concept to which we cling tenaciously is time. We think of it as being a sort of viscid substance flowing onward like a sluggish river, bearing upon its bosom nations and empires and civilizations and men. We visualize this sticky stream as an entity and ourselves as helplessly stuck in it for as long as our earthly lives endure. Or again, by a simple shift in our thinking we picture time as a revealer of the shape of things to come, as when we say \"Time will tell.\" Or we imagine it a benign physician and comfort ourselves with the thought that \"Time is a great healer.\" All this is so much a part of us that it would be too much to expect that the habit of referring everything to time could ever be broken. Yet we may guard against the harm that such thinking carries with it. The most harmful mistake we make concerning time is that it has somehow a mysterious power to perfect human nature. We say of a foolish young man \"Time will make him wiser,\" or we see a new Christian acting like anything but a Christian and hope that time will someday turn him into a saint. The truth is that time has no more power to sanctify a man than space has. Indeed, time is only a fiction by which we account for change. It is change, not time, that turns fools into wise men and sinners into saints. Or more accurately, it is Christ who does the whole thing by means of the changes He works in the heart.',' 2 Peter 3:8',' But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.',' Time does not change us, God does. He changes us as we walk by the Spirit.',' Forgive me, Lord, for trusting time rather than You. Change me, ever change me as I walk with You. For Jesus\' sake.'),(484,'That Incredible Christian',' Two',' Time Cannot Help Us','6','Change Occurs within Time but Is Not Caused by It','Saul the Persecutor became Paul the servant of God, but time did not make the change. Christ wrought the miracle, the same Christ who once changed water into wine. One spiritual experience followed another in fairly rapid succession until the violent Saul became a gentle, God-enamored soul ready to lay down his life for the faith he once hated. It should be obvious that time had no part in the making of the man of God. My purpose in writing this little piece is not to engage in an exercise in semantics but to alert my readers to the injury they may suffer from an unfounded confidence in time. Because a Moses and a Jacob lost the impulsive, headstrong sins of their youth and in their old age became gentle, mellow saints we tend to take it for granted that time wrought the transformation. But it is not so. God, not time, makes saints. Human nature is not fixed, and for this we should thank God day and night. We are still capable of change. We can become something other than what we are. By the power of the gospel the covetous man may become generous, the egotist lowly in his own eyes. The thief may learn to steal no more, the blasphemer to fill his mouth with praises unto God. But it is Christ who does it all. Time has nothing to do with it.','Psalm 31:14-15a','But I trust in you, O LORD; I say, \"You are my God.\" My times are in your hands.','God acts within time. He sometimes uses time. But He is not limited by time nor chained to it. The time we have left does not determine the transformation we may experience. Our response to the Spirit within time does.','Time cannot change me but You can, O Lord. My times are in Your hands.'),(485,'That Incredible Christian',' Two',' Time Cannot Help Us','7',' Facilitating Change',' Many a lost man is putting off the day of salvation, vaguely hoping that time is on his side, when actually the likelihood of his ever becoming a Christian grows less day by day. And why? Because the changes taking place in him are hardening his will and making it more and more difficult for him to repent. \"Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\" See the change-words in this text: \"seek... call... forsake... return.\" These all denote specific changes the returning sinner must make in himself, acts that he must perform. But this is not enough. \"Have mercy... pardon\"; these are the changes God makes in and for the man. To be saved the man must change and be changed. To enter the kingdom of God, our Lord explained, a man must be born again (John 3:3-7). That is, he must undergo a spiritual change. . . . The initial change, however, is not the only one the redeemed man will know. His whole Christian life will consist of a succession of changes, moving always toward spiritual perfection. To achieve these changes the Holy Spirit uses various means, probably the most effective being the writings of the New Testament. Time can help us only if we know that it cannot help us at all. It is change we need, and only God can change us from worse to better.',' Isaiah 55:6-7',' Seek the LORD while he may be found; call on him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts. Let him turn to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will freely pardon.',' There is a time to wait and a time to act. We sometimes confuse the two. When we know God\'s will it is always the time to do God\'s will. Are we changing?',' You, Lord, would I seek and rise up to do Your will. Change me, Lord, change me!'),(486,'That Incredible Christian',' Three',' What It Means to Accept Christ','8',' \"Accepting\" Christ','To the question \"What must I do to be saved?\" we must learn the correct answer. To fail here is not to gamble with our souls: it is to guarantee eternal banishment from the face of God. Here we must be right or be finally lost. To this anxious question evangelical Christians provide three answers, \"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,\" \"Receive Christ as your personal Saviour,\" and \"Accept Christ.\" Two of the answers are drawn almost verbatim from the Scriptures (Acts 16:31, John 1:12), while the third is a kind of paraphrase meant to sum up the other two. They are therefore not three but one. Being spiritually lazy we naturally tend to gravitate toward the easiest way of settling our religious questions for ourselves and others; hence the formula \"Accept Christ\" has become a panacea of universal application, and I believe it has been fatal to many. . . . The trouble is that the whole \"Accept Christ\" attitude is likely to be wrong. It shows Christ applying to us rather than us to Him. It makes Him stand hat-in-hand awaiting our verdict on Him, instead of our kneeling with troubled hearts awaiting His verdict on us. It may even permit us to accept Christ by an impulse of mind or emotions, painlessly, at no loss to our ego and no inconvenience to our usual way of life. For this ineffectual manner of dealing with a vital matter we might imagine some parallels; as if, for instance, . . . the prodigal son had \"accepted\" his father\'s forgiveness and stayed on among the swine in the far country. Is it not plain that if accepting Christ is to mean anything there must be moral action that accords with it?',' Acts 16:31','They replied, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.\"','Believing in Christ is not merely an intellectual exercise though it involves the mind. Believing in Christ is a heart and life commitment to the Savior, the King of kings and Lord of lords, very God of very God. Moral action results.','Thank You that You have received me; forgiven me; made me a new person; come to live in my heart. May my heart commitment to You deepen and grow day by day.'),(487,'That Incredible Christian',' Three',' What It Means to Accept Christ','9',' Bowing to Christ\'s Lordship',' Allowing the expression \"Accept Christ\" to stand as an honest effort to say in short what could not be so well said any other way, let us see what we mean or should mean when we use it. To accept Christ is to form an attachment to the Person of our Lord Jesus altogether unique in human experience. The attachment is intellectual, volitional and emotional. The believer is intellectually convinced that Jesus is both Lord and Christ; he has set his will to follow Him at any cost and soon his heart is enjoying the exquisite sweetness of His fellowship. This attachment is all-inclusive in that it joyfully accepts Christ for all that He is. There is no craven division of offices whereby we may acknowledge His Saviorhood today and withhold decision on His Lordship till tomorrow. The true believer owns Christ as his All in All without reservation. He also includes all of himself, leaving no part of his being unaffected by the revolutionary transaction. Further, his attachment to Christ is all-exclusive. The Lord becomes to him not one of several rival interests, but the one exclusive attraction forever. He orbits around Christ as the earth around the sun, held in thrall by the magnetism of His love, drawing all his life and light and warmth from Him. In this happy state he is given other interests, it is true, but these are all determined by his relation to his Lord.',' John 20:28',' Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\"',' Thomas got it right. Pushing aside doubt he recognized the Risen Savior as his Lord and God. Each of us must bow to Christ\'s lordship in all of life, all of life. Have we?',' Lord, by Your Spirit, expose to me those areas of life I have not yet surrendered to Your Lordship.'),(488,'That Incredible Christian',' Three',' What It Means to Accept Christ','10','Faith Identification with Christ','The Lord becomes to him [the believer] not one of several rival interests, but the one exclusive attraction forever. That we accept Christ in this all-inclusive, all-exclusive way is a divine imperative. Here faith makes its leap into God through the Person and work of Christ, but it never divides the work from the Person. It never tries to believe on the blood apart from Christ Himself, or the cross or the \"finished work.\" It believes on the Lord Jesus Christ, the whole Christ without modification or reservation, and thus it receives and enjoys all that He did in His work of redemption, all that He is now doing in heaven for His own and all that He does in and through them. To accept Christ is to know the meaning of the words \"as he is, so are we in this world\" (1 John 4:17). We accept His friends as our friends, His enemies as our enemies, His ways as our ways, His rejection as our rejection, His cross as our cross, His life as our life and His future as our future. If this is what we mean when we advise the seeker to accept Christ we had better explain it to him. He may get into deep spiritual trouble unless we do.','Romans 6:11-12','In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.','One with Christ through faith. As A.B. Simpson declared: \"One in His merits I stand, one as I pray in His name; all that His worth can command, I can with confidence claim. One in His faith and His love, one in His life I may be. Sealed by the heavenly','Forgive me, Lord, for living in spiritual poverty when by faith I may identify with Christ and experience abundant living.'),(489,'That Incredible Christian',' Four',' How Important is Creed?','11','Creed or Creedless?','Among certain Christians it has become quite the fashion to cry down creed and cry up experience as the only true test of Christianity. The expression \"Not creed, but Christ\" (taken, I believe, from a poem by John Oxenham) has been widely accepted as the very voice of truth and given a place alongside of the writings of prophets and apostles. When I first heard the words they sounded good. One got from them the idea that the advocates of the no-creed creed had found a precious secret that the rest of us had missed; that they had managed to cut right through the verbiage of historic Christianity and come direct to Christ without bothering about doctrine. And the words appeared to honor our Lord more perfectly by focusing attention upon Him alone and not upon mere words. But is this true? I think not. Now I have a lot of sympathy for the no-creed creedalists for I realize that they are protesting the substitution of a dead creed for a living Christ; and in this I join them wholeheartedly. But this antithesis need not exist; there is no reason for our creeds being dead just as there is no reason for our faith being dead. James tells us that there is such a thing as dead faith, but we do not reject all faith for that reason. Now the truth is that creed is implicit in every thought, word or act of the Christian life. It is altogether impossible to come to Christ without knowing at least something about Him; and what we know about Him is what we believe about Him; and what we believe about Him is our Christian creed. Otherwise stated, since our creed is what we believe, it is impossible to believe on Christ and have no creed.','1 Timothy 3:16','Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.','In 1 Tim.3:16 Paul may be quoting an early creedal hymn. A creed is intended to be a terse, succinct statement of what one believes. That statement is a basic affirmation of one\'s principal beliefs, not an exhaustive one. As believers can we be creedless',' Father, enable me to identify eternal truth from Your Word and the application of that truth to my life. Help me to major on the majors and not the minors. In Jesus\' name.'),(490,'That Incredible Christian',' Four',' How Important is Creed?','12',' Personal Creed in Development',' Preaching Christ is generally, and correctly, held to be the purest, noblest ministry in which any man can engage; but preaching Christ includes a great deal more than talking about Christ in superlatives. It means more than giving vent to the religious love the speaker feels for the Person of Christ. Glowing love for Christ will give fragrance and warmth to any sermon, but it is still not enough. Love must be intelligent and informed if it is to have any permanent meaning. The effective sermon must have intellectual content, and wherever there is intellect there is creed. It cannot be otherwise. This is not to plead for the use of the historic creeds in our Christian gatherings. I realize that it is entirely possible to recite the Apostles\' Creed every Sunday for a lifetime with no profit to the soul. The Nicene Creed may be said or sung in every service without benefiting anyone. The standard creeds are a summary of what the Christian professes to believe, and they are excellent as far as they go yet they may be learned by rote and repeated without conviction and so be altogether stale and unprofitable. While we may worship (and thousands of Christians do) without the use of any formal creed, it is impossible to worship acceptably without some knowledge of the One we seek to worship. And that knowledge is our creed whether it is ever formalized or not. It is not enough to say that we may have a mystical or numinous experience of God without any doctrinal knowledge and that is sufficient. No, it is not sufficient. We must worship in truth as well as in spirit; and truth can be stated and when it is stated it becomes creed.',' John 4:24',' God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.',' Perceiving God\'s truth enables me to verbalize that truth. That stated truth becomes my creed. That creed will be revised and refined as I learn more of the Word and seek to practice it. The Spirit will teach me, often through other believers.',' I want to worship You in truth, O God. Give me understanding of Your truth that I may live by it and share it with others.'),(491,'That Incredible Christian',' Four',' How Important is Creed?','13','You Are a Theologian!','The effort to be practicing Christians without knowing what Christianity is about must always fail. The true Christian should be, indeed must be, a theologian. He must know at least something of the wealth of truth revealed in the Holy Scriptures. And he must know it with sufficient clarity to state it and defend his statement. And what can be stated and defended is a creed. Because the heart of the Christian life is admittedly faith in a person, Jesus Christ the Lord, it has been relatively easy for some to press this truth out of all proportion and teach that faith in the Person of Christ is all that matters. Who Jesus is matters not, who His Father was, whether Jesus is God or man or both, whether or not He accepted the superstitions and errors of His time as true, whether He actually rose again after His passion or was only thought to have done so by His devoted followers—these things are not important, say the no-creed advocates. What is vital is that we believe on Him and try to follow His teachings. What is overlooked here is that the conflict of Christ with the Pharisees was over the question of who He was. His claim to be God stirred the Pharisees to fury. He could have cooled the fire of their anger by backing away from His claim to equality with God, but He refused to do it. And He further taught that faith in Him embraced a belief that He is very God, and that apart from this there could be no salvation for anyone. \"He said unto them, \'Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.\'\" To believe on Christ savingly means to believe the right things about Christ. There is no escaping this.','Matthew 16:13-15','When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say the Son of Man is?\" They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" \"But what about you?\" he asked. “Who do you say I am?”','At least informally, we are all theologians. We must all come, and we do, to theological conclusions concerning Christ. Our salvation depends upon it. Who is He to us? What has He done that concerns us? How are we relating to Him?

And it cannot be denied that it was American Fundamentalism that brought instant Christianity to the gospel churches. Ignoring for the moment Romanism, and Liberalism in its various disguises, and focusing our attention upon the great body of evangelical believers, we see at once how deeply the religion of Christ has suffered in the house of its friends. The American genius for getting things done quickly and easily with little concern for quality or permanence has bred a virus that has infected the whole evangelical church in the United States and, through our literature, our evangelists and our missionaries, has spread all over the world. Instant Christianity came in with the machine age. Men invented machines for two purposes. They wanted to get important work done more quickly and easily than they could do it by hand, and they wanted to get the work over with so they could give their time to pursuits more to their liking, such as loafing or enjoying the pleasures of the world. Instant Christianity now serves the same purposes in religion. It disposes of the past, guarantees the future and sets the Christian free to follow the more refined lusts of the flesh in all good conscience and with a minimum of restraint.','Hebrews 12:28','Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe.','\"Keep the services short and the sermons \'sound-byte size.\' People are busy these days. They don\'t have time for long services and biblical studies.\" But what about that unsatisfied hunger of heart? That worship with reverence and awe?

You are God.'),(493,'That Incredible Christian',' Five',' The Inadequacy of \"Instant Christianity\"','15',' Growing Up into Christ','By \"instant Christianity\" I mean the kind found almost everywhere in gospel circles and which is born of the notion that we may discharge our total obligation to our own souls by one act of faith, or at most by two, and be relieved thereafter of all anxiety about our spiritual condition. We are saints by calling, our teachers keep telling us, and we are permitted to infer from this that there is no reason to seek to be saints by character. An automatic, once-for-all quality is present here that is completely out of mode with the faith of the New Testament. In this error, as in most others, there lies a certain amount of truth imperfectly understood. It is true that conversion to Christ may be and often is sudden. Where the burden of sin has been heavy the sense of forgiveness is usually clear and joyful. The delight experienced in forgiveness is equal to the degree of moral repugnance felt in repentance. The true Christian has met God. He knows he has eternal life and he is likely to know where and when he received it. And those also who have been filled with the Holy Spirit subsequent to their regeneration have a clear-cut experience of being filled. The Spirit is self-announcing, and the renewed heart has no difficulty identifying His presence as He floods in over the soul. But the trouble is that we tend to put our trust in our experiences and as a consequence misread the entire New Testament. We are constantly being exhorted to make the decision, to settle the matter now, to get the whole thing taken care of at once—and those who exhort us are right in doing so. There are decisions that can be and should be made once and for all. There are personal matters that can be settled instantaneously by a determined act of the will in response to Bible-grounded faith. No one would want to deny this; certainly not I. The question before us is, Just how much can be accomplished in that one act of faith? How much yet remains to be done and how far can a single decision take us?',' Ephesians 4:15','Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.','Growing up into Christ calls for tremendous growing. It does not occur at one point in time or by means of one decision. Oh, how much growing we have yet to experience!','Lord, plant my feet on higher ground! I want to grow up into Christ. May Your Spirit fill me and change me day by day, month by month, year by year.'),(494,'That Incredible Christian',' Five',' The Inadequacy of \"Instant Christianity\"','16','Those Sanctifying Effects of Suffering','Instant Christianity tends to make the faith act terminal and so smothers the desire for spiritual advance. It fails to understand the true nature of the Christian life, which is not static but dynamic and expanding. It overlooks the fact that a new Christian is a living organism as certainly as a new baby is, and must have nourishment and exercise to assure normal growth. It does not consider that the act of faith in Christ sets up a personal relationship between two intelligent moral beings, God and the reconciled man, and no single encounter between God and a creature made in His image could ever be sufficient to establish an intimate friendship between them. By trying to pack all of salvation into one experience, or two, the advocates of instant Christianity flaunt the law of development which runs through all nature. They ignore the sanctifying effects of suffering, cross carrying and practical obedience. They pass by the need for spiritual training, the necessity of forming right religious habits, and the need to wrestle against the world, the devil and the flesh. Undue preoccupation with the initial act of believing has created in some a psychology of contentment, or at least of non-expectation. To many it has imparted a mood of disappointment with the Christian faith. God seems too far away, the world is too near, and the flesh too powerful to resist. Others are glad to accept the assurance of automatic blessedness. It relieves them of the need to watch and fight and pray, and sets them free to enjoy this world while waiting for the next. Instant Christianity is twentieth century orthodoxy. I wonder whether the man who wrote Philippians 3:7-16 would recognize it as the faith for which he finally died. I am afraid he would not.','Philippians 3:10-11','I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow to attain to the resurrection from the dead.','We want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection but what about the \"fellowship of sharing in his sufferings\"? Today there are in this world believers who are suffering with and for Christ. Some aspects of maturity are achieved only through suffe','Forgive me, Lord, for leaving behind the carrying of the cross when trying to follow You. I look for the easy way when it is through pain and suffering that You refine me and reveal Your strength.'),(495,'That Incredible Christian',' Six',' Faith\'s Foundation Is God','17',' What Is Faith?',' Remember that faith is not a noble quality found only in superior men. It is not a virtue attainable by a limited few. It is not the ability to persuade ourselves that black is white or that something we desire will come to pass if we only wish hard enough. Faith is simply the bringing of our minds into accord with the truth. It is adjusting our expectations to the promises of God in complete assurance that the God of the whole earth cannot lie. A man looks at a mountain and affirms, \"That is a mountain.\" There is no particular virtue in the affirmation. It is simply accepting the fact that stands before him and bringing his belief into accord with the fact. The man does not create the mountain by believing, nor could he annihilate it by denying. And so with the truth of God. The believing man accepts a promise of God as a fact as solid as a mountain and vastly more enduring. His faith changes nothing except his own personal relation to the word of promise. God\'s Word is true whether we believe it or not. Human unbelief cannot alter the character of God. Faith is subjective, but it is sound only when it corresponds with objective reality. The man\'s faith in the mountain is valid only because the mountain is there; otherwise it would be mere imagination and would need to be sharply corrected to rescue the man from harmful delusion. So God is what He is in Himself. He does not become what we believe. \"I AM That I AM.\" We are on safe ground only when we know what kind of God He is and adjust our entire being to the holy concept.',' Hebrews 11:1-2',' Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for.',' Faith is trusting God and what He has promised even when we cannot see and may not experience the fulfillment of those promises according to our personal calendar.',' Father, my faith finds its resting place in You, in You the Eternal God.'),(496,'That Incredible Christian',' Six',' Faith\'s Foundation Is God','18',' God Always Acts Like Himself',' Since true faith rests upon what God is, it is of utmost importance that, to the limit of our comprehension, we know what He is. \"They that know thy name will put their trust in thee\" (Psalm 9:10). The name of God is the verbal expression of His character, and confidence always rises or falls with known character. What the psalmist said was simply that they who know God to be the kind of God He is will put their confidence in Him. This is not a special virtue, I repeat, but the normal direction any mind takes when confronted with the fact. We are so made that we trust good character and distrust its opposite. That is why unbelief is so intensely wicked. \"He that believeth not God hath made him a liar\" (1 John 5:10). The character of God is the Christian\'s final ground of assurance and the solution of many, if not most, of his practical religious problems. Some persons, for instance, believe that God answered prayer in Bible times but will not do so today, and others hold that the miracles of olden days can never be repeated. To believe so is to deny or at least to ignore almost everything God has revealed about Himself. We must remember that God always acts like Himself. He has never at any time anywhere in the vast universe acted otherwise than in character with His infinite perfections. This knowledge should be a warning to the enemies of God, and it cannot but be an immense consolation to His friends.',' Hebrews 13:8',' Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.',' Horatius Bonar understood it well when he wrote: \"I change, He changes not, the Christ can never die; His love, not mine, the resting place; His truth, not mine, the tie.\"',' You are my resting place. The more I know You the more I trust You. I can trust You even when I do not understand.'),(497,'That Incredible Christian',' Six',' Faith\'s Foundation Is God','19',' Cultivating Faith',' Though God dwells in the center of eternal mystery, there need be no uncertainty about how He will act in any situation covered by His promises. These promises are infallible predictions. God will always do what He has promised to do when His conditions are met. And His warnings are no less predictive: \"The ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous\" (Psalm 1:5). In the light of all this how vain is the effort to have faith by straining to believe the promises in the Holy Scriptures. A promise is only as good as the one who made it, but it is as good, and from this knowledge springs our assurance. By cultivating the knowledge of God we at the same time cultivate our faith. Yet while so doing we look not at our faith but at Christ, its author and finisher. Thus the gaze of the soul is not in, but out and up to God. So the health of the soul is secured.',' Hebrews 12:2a',' Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.',' Confident faith comes as we know God. The better we know Him the more we will trust Him because we will understand who He is. Emphasis, then, is not so much on believing Him as it is in knowing Him.',' Lord, help me to cultivate the life-habit of gazing on You!'),(498,'That Incredible Christian',' Seven',' The Freedom of the Will','20','The Privilege of Choice','It is inherent in the nature of man that his will must be free. Made in the image of God who is completely free, man must enjoy a measure of freedom. This enables him to select his companions for this world and the next; it enables him to yield his soul to whom he will, to give allegiance to God or the devil, to remain a sinner or become a saint. And God respects this freedom. God once saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good. To find fault with the smallest thing God has made is to find fault with its Maker. It is a false humility that would lament that God wrought but imperfectly when He made man in His own image. Sin excepted, there is nothing in human nature to apologize for. This was confirmed forever when the Eternal Son became permanently incarnated in human flesh. So highly does God regard His handiwork that He will not for any reason violate it. For God to override man\'s freedom and force him to act contrary to his own will would be to make a mockery of the image of God in man. This God will never do.','Joshua 24:14-15','Now fear the LORD and serve him with all faithfulness. . . . But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, . . . But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.','Being made in the image of God brings with it the privilege of choice. Freedom to choose is not absolute but it is ours to exercise. Whom and what are we choosing?','I choose You, O Lord, and to You I submit my choices. I want to choose Your will today. Reveal it to me clearly concerning all of today\'s choices. For Jesus\' sake.'),(499,'That Incredible Christian',' Seven',' The Freedom of the Will','21','The Responsibility of Choice','Our Lord Jesus looked after the rich young ruler as he walked away, but He did not follow him or attempt to coerce him. The dignity of the young man\'s humanity forbade that his choices should be made for him by another. To remain a man he must make his own moral choices; and Christ knew this and permitted him to go his own chosen way. If his human choice took him at last to hell, at least he went there a man; and it is better for the moral universe that he should do so than that he should be jockeyed to a heaven he did not choose, a soulless, will-less automaton. God will take nine steps toward us, but He will not take the tenth. He will incline us to repent, but He cannot do our repenting for us. It is of the essence of repentance that it can only be done by the one who committed the act to be repented of. God can wait on the sinning man; He can withhold judgment; He can exercise long-suffering to the point where He appears \"lax\" in His judicial administration; but He cannot force a man to repent. To do this would be to violate the man\'s freedom and void the gift God originally bestowed upon him. Where there is no freedom of choice there can be neither sin nor righteousness, because it is of the nature of both that they be voluntary. However good an act may be, it is not good if it is imposed from without. The act of imposition destroys the moral content of the act and renders it null and void.','Mark 10:21-22','Jesus looked at him and loved him \"One thing you lack,\" he said. \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" At this the man\'s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.','Moving, isn\'t it. Jesus loved the young man who sadly went away. That rich young ruler made his choice as we make ours. Others cannot choose for us or repent for us. We are personally responsible for our choices.','O God, so important are the choices before me. You have given me personal responsibility of choice. Thank You for the revelation of Your will to guide me and the presence of Your Spirit to enable me!'),(500,'That Incredible Christian',' Seven',' The Freedom of the Will','22','Defining Sin','For an act to be sinful the quality of voluntariness must also be present. Sin is the voluntary commission of an act known to be contrary to the will of God. Where there is no moral knowledge or where there is no voluntary choice, the act is not sinful; it cannot be, for sin is the transgression of the law and transgression must be voluntary. Lucifer became Satan when he made his fateful choice: \"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High\" (Isaiah 14:14). Clearly here was a choice made against light. Both knowledge and will were present in the act. Conversely, Christ revealed His holiness when He cried in His agony, \"Not my will, but thine, be done\" (Luke 22:42). Here was a deliberate choice made with the full knowledge of the consequences. Here two wills were in temporary conflict, the lower will of the Man who was God and the higher will of the God who was Man, and the higher will prevailed. Here also was seen in glaring contrast the enormous difference between Christ and Satan; and that difference divides saint from sinner and heaven from hell. But someone may ask, \"When we pray \'Not my will, but Thine be done,\' are we not voiding our will and refusing to exercise the very power of choice which is part of the image of God in us?\" The answer to that question is a flat No, but the whole thing deserves further explanation.','Ephesians 6:10','Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.','Voluntary commissions and moral knowledge are necessary for \"sinful\" acts. We are subject to force and pressure from our sinful nature and the evil one. But the Holy Spirit is ours, too, and in His power we may choose God\'s will.','You know, Father, that I am weak-willed in many areas of life. Yet in all my weakness and failure I reach out to Your strength and mighty power.'),(501,'That Incredible Christian',' Seven',' The Freedom of the Will','23',' Choosing God\'s Will','No act that is done voluntarily is an abrogation of the freedom of will. If a man chooses the will of God he is not denying but exercising his right of choice. What he is doing is admitting that he is not good enough to desire the highest choice nor is he wise enough to make it, and he is for that reason asking Another who is both wise and good to make his choice for him. And for fallen man this is the ultimate use he should make of his freedom of will. Tennyson saw this and wrote of Christ, Thou seemest human and divine, The highest, holiest manhood, Thou; Our wills are ours, we know not how; Our wills are ours, to make them Thine.  There is a lot of sound doctrine in these words—\"Our wills are ours, to make them Thine.\" The secret of saintliness is not the destruction of the will but the submergence of it in the will of God. The true saint is one who acknowledges that he possesses from God the gift of freedom. He knows that he will never be cudgled into obedience nor wheedled like a petulant child into doing the will of God; he knows that these methods are unworthy both of God and of his own soul. He knows he is free to make any choice he will, and with that knowledge he chooses forever the blessed will of God.',' Psalm 40:8','I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.','Choosing God\'s will is a personal choice of each of us. Choosing His will as He has already and continues to show it to us is a pattern of daily living. Dramatic life change results!','My choices have often been wrong ones, Lord. I freely bow to Your choices for me. Show them to me by Your Spirit.'),(502,'That Incredible Christian',' Eight',' Living an Exchanged Life','24',' Priceless Exchange',' A great preacher whom I heard a few years ago said that the word \"renew\" in Isaiah 40:31 really meant \"exchange\"; so the text should read, \"They that wait upon the Lord shall exchange their strength.\" Oddly enough I do not now remember how he developed his sermon or just how he applied the text, but I have been thinking lately that the man had hit upon a very important idea; namely, that a large part of Christian experience consists of exchanging something worse for something better, a blessed and delightful bargain indeed. At the foundation of the Christian life lies vicarious atonement, which in essence is a transfer of guilt from the sinner to the Saviour. I well know how vigorously this idea is attacked by non-Christians, but I also know that the wise of this world in their pride often miss the treasures which the simple-hearted find on their knees; and I also remember the words of the apostle; \"He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him\" (2 Cor. 5:21). This is too plain to miss for anyone who is not willfully blind: Christ by His death on the cross made it possible for the sinner to exchange his sin for Christ\'s righteousness. It\'s that simple. No one is compelled to accept it, but at least that is what it means. And that is only the beginning. Almost everything thereafter is an exchange of the worse for the better. Next after the exchange of sin for righteousness is that of wrath for acceptance. Today the wrath of God abides upon a sinning and impenitent man; tomorrow God\'s smile rests upon him. He is the same man, but not quite, for he is now a new man in Christ Jesus. By penitence and faith he has exchanged the place of condemnation for the Father\'s house. He was rejected in himself but is now accepted in the Beloved, and this not by human means but by an act of divine grace.',' Isaiah 40:31',' But those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles.',' Those who hope or wait on the LORD renew or exchange their strength for that which is from God. As a result, they soar on wings as eagles. What a priceless exchange!',' Lord, my feeble weakness I gladly exchange for Your strength; my sin for Christ\'s righteousness; my condemnation for Your welcome.'),(503,'That Incredible Christian',' Eight',' Living an Exhanged Life','25','Personally Weak but Strong in Him','After the exchange of sin for righteousness is that of wrath for acceptance. Then comes the exchange of death for life. Christ died for dead men that they might rise to be living men. Paul\'s happy if somewhat involved testimony makes this clear: \"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me\" (Gal. 2:20). This is mysterious but not incredible. It is one more example of how the ways of God and the ways of man diverge. Man is a born cobbler. When he wants a thing to be better he goes to work to improve it. He improves cattle by careful breeding; cars and planes by streamlining; health by diet, vitamins, and surgery; plants by grafting; people by education. But God will have none of this cobbling. He makes a man better by making him a new man. He imparts a higher order of life and sets to work to destroy the old. Then as suggested in the Isaiah text, the Christian exchanges weakness for strength. I suppose it is not improper to say that God makes His people strong, but we must understand this to mean that they become strong in exact proportion to their weakness, the weakness being their own and the strength God\'s. \"When I am weak, then am I strong\" (2 Corinthians 12:10), is the way Paul said it, and in so saying set a pattern for every Christian.','2 Corinthians 13:4-5','For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God\'s power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God\'s power we will live with him to serve you. Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize th','Christ in us! He is our strength, our enablement. We are hopelessly weak in ourselves but powerfully strong in Him!','You, O Christ, are in me. How can it be? You are my only hope of glory. You are my strength. Hallelujah! That Incredible Christian'),(504,'That Incredible Christian',' Eight',' Living an Exhanged Life','26','Live by the Spirit','Actually the purest saint at the moment of his greatest strength is as weak as he was before his conversion. What has happened is that he has switched from his little human battery to the infinite power of God. He has quite literally exchanged weakness for strength, but the strength is not his; it flows into him from God as long as he abides in Christ. One of the heaviest problems in the Christian life is that of sanctification: how to become as pure as we know we ought to be and must be if we are to enjoy intimate communion with a holy God. The classic expression of this problem and its solution is found in Paul\'s epistle to the Romans, chapters seven and eight. The cry, \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\" (7:24) receives the triumphant answer, \"The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death\" (8:2). No one who has given attention to the facts will deny that it is altogether possible for a man to attain to a high degree of external morality if he sets his heart to it. Marcus Aurelius, the pagan emperor, for instance, lived a life of such exalted morality as to make most of us Christians ashamed, as did also the lowly slave Epictetus; but holiness was something of which they were totally ignorant. And it is holiness that the Christian heart yearns for above all else, and holiness the human heart can never capture by itself.','Galatians 5:16','So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.','We can live today by the Spirit. In ourselves we are hopelessly weak failures. In Christ we are strong because of His strength. Let\'s live today by the Spirit!','You know my weakness, Lord, far better than I do.

Simpson knew by experience the unavailing struggle to be holy, and he knew also the Bible way to holiness. In a little hymn composed to be spoken at the conclusion of one of his sermons he states it this way: I take Him as my holiness, My spirit\'s spotless, heavenly dress, I take the Lord my righteousness- I take, He undertakes. We have but to abandon the effort to be holy and trust God to do the work within us. He will surely undertake. There are many other happy exchanges we Christians may make if we will, among them being our ignorance for His knowledge, our folly for His wisdom, our demerit for His merit, our sad mortality for His blessed immortality and faith for sight at last.',' Philippians 4:13',' I can do everything through him who gives me strength.',' As we give ourselves to Christ, He undertakes for us. We cannot make ourselves holy but He can and will as we rest in Him.

Power for service is but one effect of the experience, and I do not hesitate to say that it is the least of several effects. It is least for the very reason that it touches service, presumably service to mankind; and contrary to the popular belief, \"to serve this present age\" is not the Christian\'s first duty nor the chief end of man. As I have stated elsewhere, the two great verbs that dominate the life of man are be and do. What a man is comes first in the sight of God. What he does is determined by what he is, so is is of first importance always. The modern notion that we are \"saved to serve,\" while true, is true only in a wider context, and as understood by busy Christians today it is not true at all. Redemption became necessary not because of what men were doing only, but because of what they were. Not human conduct alone had gone wrong but human nature as well; apart from the moral defect in human nature no evil conduct would have occurred. Fallen men acted in accord with what they were. Their hearts dictated their deeds. \"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth\" (Gen. 6:54). That much any moral being could have seen. But God saw more; He saw the cause of man\'s wicked ways, and that \"every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually\" (6:5). The stream of human conduct flows out of a fountain polluted by evil thoughts and imaginations. To purge the stream it was necessary to purify the fountain; and to reform human conduct it is necessary to regenerate human nature. The fundamental be must be sanctified if we would have a righteous do, for being and doing are related as cause and effect, as father and son.','1 Thessalonians 5:23','May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through.','We emphasize \"doing\" — getting things done and so making a difference in this world. But in God\'s order \"being\" precedes \"doing.\" \"Being\" affects how and why we do as well as what we do.','Sometimes I try to camouflage what I am by what I do. But Father, You know the real me. And it is the me who must be changed. Purify my heart, O God!'),(507,'That Incredible Christian',' Nine',' Why the Holy Spirit Is Given','29',' Worshipers then Workers',' The primary work of the Holy Spirit is to restore the lost soul to intimate fellowship with God through the washing of regeneration. To accomplish this He first reveals Christ to the penitent heart (1 Cor. 12:3). He then goes on to illumine the newborn soul with brighter rays from the face of Christ (John 14:26; 16:13-15) and leads the willing heart into depths and heights of divine knowledge and communion. Remember, we know Christ only as the Spirit enables us and we have only as much of Him as the Holy Spirit imparts. God wants worshipers before workers; indeed the only acceptable workers are those who have learned the lost art of worship. It is inconceivable that a sovereign and holy God should be so hard up for workers that He would press into service anyone who had been empowered regardless of his moral qualifications. The very stones would praise Him if the need arose and a thousand legions of angels would leap to do His will. Gifts and power for service the Spirit surely desires to impart; but holiness and spiritual worship come first.',' John 16:14',' He [the Holy Spirit] will bring glory to me by taking what is mine and making it known to you.',' Worshipful workers, that\'s what God wants us to be. It is by worshiping in spirit and in truth that we become worshipful workers. For most of us it is easier to work than worship. Out of a worshiping heart we can do all things to the glory of God.',' O Holy Spirit, show me Christ and the things of Christ. Help me to worshipfully gaze on Him and then worshipfully serve Him.'),(508,'That Incredible Christian',' Ten',' God Walking among Men','30',' Delighted Wonder!',' God always acts like Himself, wherever He may be and whatever He may be doing; in Him there is neither variableness nor shadow of turning. Yet His infinitude places Him so far above our knowing that a lifetime spent in cultivating the knowledge of Him leaves as much yet to learn as if we had never begun. God\'s limitless knowledge and perfect wisdom enable Him to work rationally beyond the bounds of our rational knowing. For this reason we cannot predict God\'s actions as we can predict the movements of the heavenly bodies, so He constantly astonishes us as He moves in freedom through His universe. So imperfectly do we know Him that it may be said that one invariable concomitant of a true encounter with God is delighted wonder. No matter how high our expectation may be, when God finally moves into the field of our spiritual awareness we are sure to be astonished by His power to be more wonderful than we anticipate, and more blessed and marvelous than we had imagined He could be. Yet in a measure His actions may be predicted, for, as I have said, He always acts like Himself. Since we know, for instance, that God is love, we may be perfectly sure that love will be present in His every act, whether it be the salvation of a penitent sinner or the destruction of an impenitent world. Similarly we can know that He will always be just, faithful, merciful and true.',' Psalm 119:64a',' The earth is filled with your love, O LORD.',' It is for us to discover the delighted wonder of God. As we do, we find as did Frederick Faber: \". . . the love of God is broader than the measures of man\'s mind; and the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind.\"',' Your wonder, O God, is beyond my ability to take in. Your infinite love and kindness is You even when I cannot understand their expression.'),(509,'That Incredible Christian',' Ten',' God Walking among Men','31','As the Son so the Father','It is a rare mind, I suppose, that is much concerned with the conduct of God in those distant realms that lie beyond human experience. But almost everyone has wondered how God would act if He were in our place. And we may have had moments when we felt that God could not possibly understand how hard it is for us to live right in such an evil world as this. And we may have wondered how He would act and what He would do if He were to live among us for a while. To wonder thus may be natural but it is wholly needless. We know how God would act if He were in our place — He has been in our place. It is the mystery of godliness that God was manifest in human flesh. They called His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. When Jesus walked on earth He was a man acting like God; but equally wonderful is it that He was also God acting like Himself in man and in a man. We know how God acts in heaven because we saw Him act on earth. \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, \'Show us the Father?\'\" (John 14:9). As glorious as this is, it does not end there. God is still walking in men, and wherever He walks He acts like Himself. This is not poetry but plain, hard fact capable of being tested in the laboratory of life.','John 14:9','Jesus answered: \"Don\'t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you for such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.\"','Follow Jesus through the four Gospels. See Him as He interacts with people in daily life, all kinds of people. Listen to His words. Consider His actions. In getting to know Jesus Christ we come to know the Father.','You walk among us, Lord. You express Yourself through Your people and by Your Spirit. You are here in my highest and lowest moments. Thank You!'),(510,'That Incredible Christian',' Ten',' God Walking among Men','32',' Houses of God',' That Christ actually inhabits the nature of the regenerate believer is assumed, implied and overtly stated in the Holy Scriptures. All the Persons of the Godhead are said to enter the nature of the one that engages New Testament truth in faith and obedience. \"If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him\" (John 14:23). And the doctrine of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is too well known to need support here; everyone that is taught even slightly in the Word of God understands this. Whatever God is, the Man Christ Jesus is also. It has been the firm belief of the Church from the days of the apostles that God is not only manifest in Christ but that He is manifest as Christ. In the days of the Arian controversy the church fathers were driven to put the teaching of the New Testament on this subject into a highly condensed \"rule\" or creed which might be accepted as final by all believers. This they did in the following words: The right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man. God of the substance of His Father, begotten before all ages: Man of the substance of His mother, born in the world.  Perfect God and perfect Man. . . . As the reasonable soul and flesh is one man: so God and man is one Christ.',' John 14:23',' Jesus replied, \"If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.\"',' God stoops to make His home with us! In us! He is closer than friends, family and loved ones around us. We are His temple.',' How can it be, O Lord, that You live in me? How can it be? I cannot comprehend it but I open to You all of me.'),(511,'That Incredible Christian',' Ten',' God Walking among Men','33',' Tension Between the Old Nature and the New',' Christ in a believer\'s heart will act the same as He acted in Galilee and Judea. His disposition is the same now as then. He was holy, righteous, compassionate, meek and humble then, and He has not changed. He is the same wherever He is found, whether it be at the right hand of God or in the nature of a true disciple. He was friendly, loving, prayerful, kindly, worshipful, self-sacrificing while walking among men; is it not reasonable to expect Him to be the same when walking in men? Why then do true Christians sometimes act in an un-Christlike manner? Some would assume that when a professed Christian fails to show forth the moral beauty of Christ in his life it is a proof that he has been deceived and is actually not a real Christian at all. But the explanation is not so simple as that. The truth is that while Christ dwells in the believer\'s new nature, He has strong competition from the believer\'s old nature. The warfare between the old and the new goes on continually in most believers. This is accepted as inevitable, but the New Testament does not so teach. A prayerful study of Romans 6 to 8 points the way to victory. If Christ is allowed complete sway He will live in us as He lived in Galilee.',' Galatians 5:24-25',' Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.',' Christ in us does not mean that we no longer are. Our old nature is not ripped out. Christ will change us and live out through us as we daily live under His control.',' Thank You, Lord, for Your patience with me. I sometimes stumble and miserably fail. But You convict me and forgive me. Live through me!'),(512,'That Incredible Christian',' Eleven',' The Divine Indwelling','34',' Divinely Occupied',' The doctrine of the divine indwelling is one of the most important in the New Testament, and its meaning for the individual Christian is precious beyond all description. To neglect it is to suffer serious loss. The apostle Paul prayed for the Ephesian Christians that Christ might dwell in their hearts by faith. Surely it takes faith of a more than average vitality to grasp the full implications of this great truth. Two facts join to make the doctrine difficult to accept: the supreme greatness of God and the utter sinfulness of man. Those who think poorly of God and well of themselves may chatter idly of \"the deity within,\" but the man who trembles before the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, the man who knows the depth of his own sin, will detect a moral incongruity in the teaching that One so holy should dwell in the heart of one so vile. But however incongruous it may appear to be, in the Holy Scriptures it is taught so fully that it cannot be overlooked and so plainly that it can hardly be misunderstood. \"If a man love me,\" said our Lord Jesus Christ, \"he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him\" (John 14:23). That this abiding is within the man is shown by these words: \"At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you\" (14: 20). Christ said of the Holy Spirit: \"He ... shall be in you\" (14: 17), and in His great prayer in John 17 our Lord twice used the words \"I in them.\"',' Ephesians 3:16-17a',' I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.',' God in us. God in us! But He doesn\'t take over as would be His right as God. It is for us to turn our heart-house over to Him. As we do He changes us.',' Thank You, Lord, You don\'t remodel me. You make me new!'),(513,'That Incredible Christian',' Eleven',' The Divine Indwelling','35','God Lives in People','The truth of the divine indwelling is developed more fully in the epistles of Paul. \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? . . . For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are\" (1 Cor. 3:16-17). And again (1 Cor. 6:19), \"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\" Without question, the teaching of the New Testament is that the very God Himself inhabits the nature of His true children. How this can be I do not know, but neither do I know how my soul inhabits my body. Paul called this wonder of the indwelling God a rich mystery: \"Christ in you, the hope of glory\" (Col. 1:27). And if the doctrine involved a contradiction or even an impossibility we must still believe what the mouth of the Lord has spoken. \"Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar\" (Rom. 3:4). The spiritual riches lying buried in this truth are so vast that they are worth any care or effort we may give to their recovery. Yet we are not concerned primarily with the theology or metaphysics embodied here. We want to know the reality of it. What does the truth mean to us in practical outworking? What does it have for a serious-minded Christian compelled to live in a dark and godless world? As Paul would say, \"Much every way\" (3:2).','1 Corinthians 6:19-20','Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought with a price. Therefore honor God with your body.','From the context and the grammar it is clear that in 1 Cor. 3:16, Paul is referring to the church, the body of believers, as God\'s temple. In 6:19, it is individual believers whose body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. God does not live in buildings (cf. Ac','O God, that You should dwell in a shack, a rat-hole like me! Tear me down and make me Your temple.'),(514,'That Incredible Christian',' Eleven',' The Divine Indwelling','36',' Doing God\'s Will',' God does not dwell passively in His people; He wills and works in them (Phil. 2:13); and remember, wherever He is, God always acts like Himself. He will do in us whatever His holy nature moves Him to do; and unless He is hindered by our resistance He will act in us precisely as He acts in heaven. Only an unsanctified human will can prevent Him. Without doubt we hinder God greatly by our willfulness and our unbelief. We fail to cooperate with the holy impulses of the in-living Spirit; we go contrary to His will as it is revealed in the Scriptures, either because we have not taken time to discover what the Bible teaches or because we do not approve it when we do. This contest between the indwelling Deity and our own fallen propensities occupies a large place in New Testament theology. But the warfare need not continue indefinitely. Christ has made full provision for our deliverance from the bondage of the flesh. A frank and realistic presentation of the whole thing is set forth in Romans 6 and 7, and in the 8th chapter a triumphant solution is discovered: it is, briefly, through a spiritual crucifixion with Christ followed by resurrection and an infusion of the Holy Spirit.',' Philippians 2:13',' For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.',' God works in us to will to act according to His good purpose. It is for us to acknowledge His will and to do it by His enablement.',' There are areas in my life, Lord, where I have known Your will but failed to do it. Forgive me for wasted opportunities and hindering Your transforming process in me.'),(515,'That Incredible Christian',' Eleven',' The Divine Indwelling','37',' Making God Feel At Home',' Once the heart is freed from its contrary impulses, Christ within becomes a wondrous experiential fact. The surrendered heart has no more controversy with God, so He can live in us congenial and uninhibited. Then He thinks His own thoughts in us: thoughts about ourselves, about Himself, about sinners and saints and babes and harlots; thoughts about the Church, about sin and judgment and hell and heaven. And He thinks about us and Himself and His love for us and our love for Him; and He woos us to Himself as a bridegroom woos his bride. Yet there is nothing formal or automatic about His operations within us. We are personalities and we are engaged with personality. We are intelligent and have wills of our own. We can, so to speak, stand outside of ourselves and discipline ourselves into accord with the will of God. We can commune with our own hearts upon our beds and be still. We can talk to our God in the night watches. We can learn what He wants us to be, and pray and work to prepare Him a habitation. And what kind of habitation pleases God? What must our natures be like before He can feel at home within us? He asks nothing but a pure heart and a single mind. He asks no rich paneling, no rugs from the Orient, no art treasures from afar. He desires but sincerity, transparency, humility, and love. He will see to the rest.',' 1 Peter 3:15a',' But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord.',' Does God feel at home in you and me? Have we confined Him to the \"guestroom\" or opened all of our heart-house to Him? Is He treated as a guest or the LORD?',' Be Lord of all my life, O God. Make me what You want me to be so that You will feel at home!'),(516,'That Incredible Christian',' Twelve',' We Are Saved to as Well as From','38',' The From\'s and To\'s','The evangelical Church today is in the awkward position of being wrong while it is right, and a little preposition makes the difference. One place where we are wrong while we are right is in the relative stress we lay upon the prepositions to and from when they follow the word saved. For a long generation we have been holding the letter of truth while at the same time we have been moving away from it in spirit because we have been preoccupied with what we are saved from rather than what we have been saved to. The right relative importance of the two concepts is set forth by Paul in his first epistle to the Thessalonians: \"Ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; and to wait for his Son from heaven\" (1 Thess. 1:9-10). The Christian is saved from his past sins. With these he simply has nothing more to do; they are among the things to be forgotten as the night is forgotten at the dawning of the day. He is also saved from the wrath to come. With this also he has nothing to do. It exists, but not for him. Sin and wrath have a cause-and-effect relationship, and because for the Christian sin is canceled wrath is canceled also. The from\'s of the Christian life concern negatives, and to be engrossed in them is to live in a state of negation. Yet that is where many earnest believers live most of the time.',' Thessalonians 1:9b-10','They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.','There is that from which we turn and that to which we turn. \"From\" suggests the past. \"To\" the present and the future. In what direction are we headed?','Father, I thank You for that from which You have brought me. Expectantly I gaze on that to which you are leading me.'),(517,'That Incredible Christian',' Twelve',' We Are Saved to as Well as From','39','Pressing Toward the Goal Ahead','We are not called to fellowship with nonexistence. We are called to things that exist in truth, to positive things, and it is as we become occupied with these that health comes to the soul. Spiritual life cannot feed on negatives. The man who is constantly reciting the evils of his unconverted days is looking in the wrong direction. He is like a man trying to run a race while looking back over his shoulder. What the Christian used to be is altogether the least important thing about him. What he is yet to be is all that should concern him. He may occasionally, as Paul sometimes did, remember to his own shame the life he once lived; but that should be only a quick glance; it is never to be a fixed gaze. Our long permanent look is on God and the glory that shall be revealed. What we are saved from and what we are saved to bear the same relation to each other as a serious illness and recovered health. The physician should stand between these two opposites to save from one and restore to the other. Once the great sickness is cured the memory of it should be thrust out onto the margin of the mind to grow fainter and weaker as it retreats farther away; and the fortunate man whose health has been restored should go on to use his new strength to accomplish something useful for mankind. Yet many persons permit their sick bodies to condition their mental stuff so that after the body has gotten well they still retain the old feeling of chronic invalidism they had before. They are recovered, true enough, but not to anything. We have but to imagine a group of such persons testifying every Sunday about their late illnesses and singing plaintive songs about them and we have a pretty fair picture of many gatherings among Christians today.','Philippians 3:14','I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.','To remember God\'s past blessings and deliverances encourages us to walk trustfully in the present. However, to frequently relive our past failures is to lose direction and focus in following God today and tomorrow.','O Lord, You have so much more for me to experience in following You. I press forward, toward the goal to which You point me.'),(518,'That Incredible Christian',' Twelve',' We Are Saved to as Well as From','40',' No Looking Back',' There is an art of forgetting, and every Christian should become skilled in it. Forgetting the things which are behind is a positive necessity if we are to become more than mere babes in Christ. If we cannot trust God to have dealt effectually with our past we may as well throw in the sponge now and have it over with. Fifty years of grieving over our sins cannot blot out their guilt. But if God has indeed pardoned and cleansed us, then we should count it done and waste no more time in sterile lamentations. And thank God this sudden obliteration of our familiar past does not leave us with a vacuum. Far from it. Into the empty world vacated by our sins and failures rushes the blessed Spirit of God, bringing with Him everything new. New life, new hope, new enjoyments, new interests, new purposeful toil, and best of all a new and satisfying object toward which to direct our soul\'s enraptured gaze. God now fills the recovered garden, and we may without fear walk and commune with Him in the cool of the day. Right here is where the weakness of much current Christianity lies. We have not learned where to lay our emphasis. Particularly we have not understood that we are saved to know God, to enter His wonder-filled Presence through the new and living way and remain in that Presence forever. We are called to an everlasting preoccupation with God. The Triune God with all of His mystery and majesty is ours and we are His, and eternity will not be long enough to experience all that He is of goodness, holiness and truth. In heaven they rest not day or night in their ecstatic worship of the Godhead. We profess to be headed for that place; shall we not begin now to worship on earth as we shall do in heaven?',' Luke 9:62',' Jesus replied, \"No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.\"',' There are things Satan does not want us to forget.

Upon You would I gaze in heart worship.'),(519,'That Incredible Christian',' Thirteen',' Will and Emotion in the Christian Life','41','Seeing with Compassion','\"Excitement, perturbation, feeling.\" These are states of mind we are all familiar with. In a world as violent and full of conflict as this these come and go, blaze up and die down in the average man\'s bosom a hundred times a day. The normal man and woman will in the course of a few months experience every degree of emotion from near ecstasy to mild dejection without apparently being any the better or the worse for it. Of course I have in mind here only the normal man and woman. The psychopathic personality lies outside the field of this study. The emotions are neither to be feared nor despised, for they are a normal part of us as God made us in the first place. Indeed the full human life would be impossible without them. One recoils from the thought of the man who lacked all feeling. He would be either a cold, naked intellect such as inhabits the pages of the science-fiction novel, or a mere vegetable, such as is sometimes found in the incurable wards of our mental hospitals. The right relation of intellect to feeling and feeling to will is disclosed in Matthew 14:14. \"And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.\" Intellectual knowledge of the suffering of the people stirred His pity and His pity moved Him to heal them. This is how it was with the ideal Man whose total organism was perfectly adjusted to itself; and this is the way it is with us in a less perfect measure.','Matthew 9:36','When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.','Jesus looked on the crowds of people. So did the disciples. Jesus saw people harassed and helpless. The disciples saw people. Jesus saw sheep without a shepherd. He saw a harvest to be reaped. The disciples seem to have seen just people. What do we see w','Lord Jesus, give me a compassionate heart that I may see and feel and respond as You do.'),(520,'That Incredible Christian',' Thirteen',' Will and Emotion in the Christian Life','42','Those Mental Pictures','A state of emotion always comes between the knowledge and the act. A feeling of pity would never arise in the human breast unless aroused by a mental picture of others\' distress, and without the emotional bump to set off the will there would be no act of mercy. That is the way we are constituted. Whether the emotion aroused by a mental picture be pity, love, fear, desire, grief, there can be no act of the will without it. What I am saying here is nothing new. Every mother, every statesman, every leader of men, every preacher of the Word of God knows that a mental picture must be presented to the listener before he can be moved to act, even though it be for his own advantage. God intended that the truth should move us to moral action. The mind receives ideas, mental pictures of things as they are. These excite the feelings and these in turn move the will to act in accordance with the truth. That is the way it should be, and would be had not sin entered and wrought injury to our inner life. Because of sin the simple sequence of truth-feeling-action may break down in any of its three parts. The mind which is created to receive truth is often turned over to falsehood, and the feeling thus aroused may incite the will to evil action. The contemplation of any wrong or forbidden thing cannot but inflame the feelings to sympathy with evil. A regrettable example of this was David\'s long gaze at the beautiful Bathsheba in the act of bathing. The king was moved by what he saw and acted accordingly, and the bitter and tragic consequences dogged him to the end of this days. He saw, he felt, he acted, precisely as his Lord did centuries later when He healed the sick. The difference in the moral quality of the acts of the two men resulted from the difference in their feelings. David saw a beautiful woman; Christ saw a suffering multitude. One gaze led to sin, the other to an act of mercy; but both followed the simple law of their inner structure.','Philippians 4:8','Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely; whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.','A common misperception is that we can think about sinful acts and enjoy them emotionally yet never actually commit them. However, a weakening of the will results which eventually leads to sinful actions.','Lord, may I use the freedom You have given me to think on that which is excellent and praiseworthy. Truth, then, will move me to moral, not immoral, action.'),(521,'That Incredible Christian',' Thirteen',' Will and Emotion in the Christian Life','43',' The Danger of Heart-hardening','Another breakdown in the truth—feeling—act sequence comes when the heart for selfish reasons deliberately hardens itself against the Word of God. This is the state of all who love darkness rather than light and for that reason either withdraw from the light altogether or when exposed to it stubbornly refuse to obey it. The covetous man looks on human need and sternly refuses to be moved by it. To yield to the impulse of generosity naturally aroused by the sight of poverty would require him to give up some of his cherished hoard, and this he will not do. So the fountain of generosity is frozen at its source. The miser keeps his gold, the poor man suffers on in his poverty and the whole course of nature is upset. Is it any wonder that God hates covetousness? But be sure that human feelings can never be completely stifled. If they are forbidden their normal course, like a river they will cut another channel through the life and flow out to curse and ruin and destroy. The Christian who gazes too long on the carnal pleasures of this world cannot escape a certain feeling of sympathy with them, and that feeling will inevitably lead to behavior that is worldly. And to expose our hearts to truth and consistently refuse or neglect to obey the impulses it arouses is to stymie the motions of life within us and, if persisted in, to grieve the Holy Spirit into silence. The Scriptures and our own human constitution agree to teach us to love truth and to obey the sweet impulses of righteousness it raises within us. If we love our own souls we dare do nothing else.',' Hebrews 4:7c','Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.','Truth arouses emotion and incites to action. So does error. If we reject the truth and embrace error the consequence is heart-hardening.','Forgive me, Father, for those times when I have rejected Your truth and the emotions aroused thus refusing to obey You.

Throughout the whole world error and truth travel the same highways, work in the same fields and factories, attend the same churches, fly in the same planes and shop in the same stores. So skilled is error at imitating truth that the two are constantly being mistaken for each other. It takes a sharp eye these days to know which brother is Cain and which Abel. We must never take for granted anything that touches our soul\'s welfare. Isaac felt Jacob\'s arms and thought they were the arms of Esau. Even the disciples failed to spot the traitor among them; the only one of them who knew who he was was Judas himself. That soft-spoken companion with whom we walk so comfortably and in whose company we take such delight may be an angel of Satan, whereas that rough, plain-spoken man whom we shun may be God\'s very prophet sent to warn us against danger and eternal loss.',' Genesis 27:21',' Then Isaac said to Jacob, \"Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.\"',' Often we encounter error disguised as truth. Crucial is our relationship to the Holy Spirit who seeks to guide into all truth. It is the Spirit who can unmask the deceiver.',' O God, I am easily deceived.

These are prayer, faith, constant meditation on the Scriptures, obedience, humility, hard, serious thought and the illumination of the Holy Spirit. 1. Prayer is not a sure fire protection against error for the reason that there are many kinds of prayer and some of them are worse than useless. The prophets of Baal leaped upon the altar in a frenzy of prayer, but their cries went unregarded because they prayed to a god that did not exist. The God the Pharisees prayed to did exist, but He refused to listen to them because of their self-righteousness and pride. From them we may well learn a profitable lesson in reverse. In spite of the difficulties we encounter when we pray, prayer is a powerful and effective way to get right, stay right and stay free from error. \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him\" (James 1:5). All things else being equal, the praying man is less likely to think wrong than the man who neglects to pray. \"Men ought always to pray, and not to faint\" (Luke 18:1). 2. The apostle Paul calls faith a shield. The man of faith can walk at ease, protected by his simple confidence in God. God loves to be trusted, and He puts all heaven at the disposal of the trusting soul. But when we talk of faith let us know what we mean. Faith is not optimism, though it may breed optimism; it is not cheerfulness, though the man of faith is likely to be reasonably cheerful; it is not a vague sense of well-being or a tender appreciation for the beauty of human togetherness. Faith is confidence in God\'s self-revelation as found in the Holy Scriptures.','Ephesians 6:16, 18','In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. . . . And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.','We learn to pray by praying and we learn to believe God by believing Him. There are many kinds of prayers in which to engage. There are all kinds of flaming arrows from the evil one against whom we must use the shield of faith.

The Scriptures purify, instruct, strengthen, enlighten and inform. The blessed man will meditate in them day and night. 4. To be entirely safe from the devil\'s snares the man of God must be completely obedient to the Word of the Lord. The driver on the highway is safe, not when he reads the signs but when he obeys them. So it is with the Scriptures. To be effective they must be obeyed. 5. Again, there is a close relation between humility and the perception of truth. \"The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way\" (Psa. 25:9). In the Scriptures I find no shred of encouragement for the proud. Only the tame sheep can be led; only the humble child need expect the guidance of the Father\'s hand. When all the evidence is in it may well be found that none but the proud ever strayed from the truth and that self-trust was behind every heresy that ever afflicted the church.','Romans 10:17','Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.','Knowing God\'s Word and obediently applying it in daily life is God\'s provision for us. Humility before Him is the only reasonable posture of heart. He is Godness. We are creatureliness.','Thank You for Your Word in a language I can understand.

Then we must think. Human thought has its limitations, but where there is no thinking there is not likely to be any large deposit of truth in the mind. Evangelicals at the moment appear to be divided into two camps — those who trust the human intellect to the point of sheer rationalism, and those who are shy of everything intellectual and are convinced that thinking is a waste of the Christian\'s time. Surely both are wrong. Self-conscious intellectualism is offensive to man and, I am convinced, to God also, but it is significant that every major revelation in the Scriptures was made to a man of superior intellect. It would be easy to marshal an imposing list of Biblical quotations exhorting us to think, but a more convincing argument is the whole drift of the Bible itself. The Scriptures simply take for granted that the saints of the Most High will be serious-minded, thoughtful persons. They never leave the impression that it is sinful to think. 7. But thinking apart from the inward illumination of the Holy Spirit is not only futile, it is likely to be dangerous as well. The human intellect is fallen and can no more find its way through the broad expanse of truth, half-truth and downright error than a ship can find its way over the ocean alone. God has given us the Holy Spirit to illuminate our minds. He is eyes and understanding to us. We dare not try to get on without Him.','Psalm 119:18','Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.','Illumination of the inspired scriptures is a continuing ministry of the Holy Spirit. So, too, is His teaching, His convicting and His opening of our minds to understand God\'s truth and His will. It is for us to immerse ourselves in the Word and listen fo','Open my mind, illumine me, Holy Spirit divine!'),(526,'That Incredible Christian',' Fifteen',' Our Tendency toward Religious Lopsidedness','48',' Spiritual Balance',' It is a thin and rather smooth coin of common knowledge that the human race has lost its symmetry and tends to be lopsided in almost everything it is and does. Religious philosophers have recognized this asymmetry and have sought to correct it by preaching in one form or another the doctrine of the \"golden mean.\" Confucius taught the \"middle way\"; Buddha would have his followers avoid both asceticism and bodily ease; Aristotle believed that the virtuous life is the one perfectly balanced between excess and defect. Christianity, being in full accord with all the facts of existence, takes into account this moral imbalance in human life, and the remedy it offers is not a new philosophy but a new life. The ideal to which the Christian aspires is not to walk in the perfect way but to be transformed by the renewing of his mind and conformed to the likeness of Christ. The regenerate man often has a more difficult time of it than the unregenerate, for he is not one man but two. He feels within him a power that tends toward holiness and God, while at the same time he is still a child of Adam\'s flesh and a son of the red clay. This moral dualism is to him a source of distress and struggle wholly unknown to the once-born man. Of course the classic critique upon this is Paul\'s testimony in the seventh chapter of his Roman epistle.',' Romans 7:21',' So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.',' God has given the Holy Spirit to believers not just to be our moral compass but our spiritual power. Submitting to the Spirit\'s control in daily life enables us to overcome the evil nature and live consistent with the new.',' In Your strength, O Holy Spirit, I dare to battle foes within and foes without. Only in Your strength.'),(527,'That Incredible Christian',' Fifteen',' Our Tendency toward Religious Lopsidedness','49',' Growing Up in Christ','The true Christian is a saint in embryo. The heavenly genes are in him and the Holy Spirit is working to bring him on into a spiritual development that accords with the nature of the heavenly Father from whom he received the deposit of divine life. Yet he is here in this mortal body subject to weakness and temptation, and his warfare with the flesh sometimes leads him to do extreme things. \"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would\" (Gal. 5:17). The work of the Spirit in the human heart is not an unconscious or automatic thing. Human will and intelligence must yield to and cooperate with the benign intentions of God. I think it is here that many of us go astray. Either we try to make ourselves holy and fail miserably, as we certainly must; or we seek to achieve a state of spiritual passivity and wait for God to perfect our natures in holiness as one might sit down and wait for a robin egg to hatch or a rose to burst into bloom. So we work feverishly to do the impossible or we do not work at all; and there lies the asymmetry about which I write. The New Testament knows nothing of the working of the Spirit in us apart from our own moral responses. Watchfulness, prayer, self-discipline and intelligent acquiescence in the purposes of God are indispensable to any real progress in holiness.',' Galatians 5:16','So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.','Growing up in Christ is not automatic. God provides full enablement. Our part is to consciously appropriate that enablement—living day by day by the Spirit.','Today, Lord, I want to live for You; to walk by Your Spirit; to do Your will. I freely confess that only by Your enablement can I so live.'),(528,'That Incredible Christian',' Fifteen',' Our Tendency toward Religious Lopsidedness','50','Avoiding Spiritual Deformity','There are areas in our lives where in our effort to be right we may go wrong, so wrong as to lead to spiritual deformity. To be specific let me name a few: 1. When in our determination to be bold we become brazen. Courage and meekness are compatible qualities: both were found in perfect proportion in Christ and both shone in beauty in His conflict with His enemies. Peter before the Sanhedrin and Paul before Agrippa demonstrated both qualities, though on another occasion when Paul\'s boldness temporarily lost its charity and became carnal he said to the high priest, \"God shall smite thee, thou whited wall.\" It is to the credit of the apostle that when he saw what he had done he immediately apologized (Acts 25:1-5). 2. When in our desire to be frank we become rude. Candor without rudeness was always found in the man Christ Jesus. The Christian who boasts that he always calls a spade a spade is likely to end by calling everything a spade. Even the fiery Peter learned that love does not blurt out everything it knows (1 Peter 4:8) 3. When in our effort to be watchful we become suspicious. Because there are many adversaries the temptation is to see enemies where none exist. Because we are in conflict with error we tend to develop a spirit of hostility to everyone who disagrees with us on anything. Satan cares little whether we go astray after a false doctrine or merely turn sour. Either way he wins.','1 Peter 4:8','Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins.','Meekness, graciousness and trust consistently expressed in resisting ungodliness is God\'s pattern for us. Satan is delighted when we resort to unkind negativism paraded as godliness.','O Lord, teach me more of love living.'),(529,'That Incredible Christian',' Fifteen',' Our Tendency toward Religious Lopsidedness','51','Living in Joy and Peace','There are areas in our lives where in our effort to be right we may go wrong, so wrong as to lead to spiritual deformity. To be specific let me name a few: 4. When we seek to be serious and become somber. The saints have always been serious, but gloominess is a defect of character and should never be equated with godliness. Religious melancholy may indicate the presence of unbelief or sin and if long continued may lead to serious mental disturbance. Joy is a great therapeutic for the mind. \"Rejoice in the Lord alway\" (Phil. 4:4). 5. When we mean to be conscientious and become overscrupulous. If the devil cannot succeed in destroying the conscience he will settle for making it sick. I know Christians who live in a state of constant distress, fearing that they may displease God. Their world of permitted acts becomes narrower year by year till at last they fear to engage in the common pursuits of life. They believe this self-torture to be a proof of godliness, but how wrong they are. These are but a few examples of serious imbalance in the Christian life. I trust the remedy has been suggested as we went along.','Galatians 5:22','But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace . . .','There is a freedom of spirit we may experience as believers. Joy and peace are part of the fruit of the Spirit. Gloom and inner turmoil are not!','Lord, may Your joy and peace spill out of me and splash those around me. For Jesus\' sake.'),(530,'That Incredible Christian',' Sixteen',' The Need for Divine Illumination','52',' Spiritual Truth Is Spiritually Discerned',' Surely God has that to say to the pure in heart which He cannot say to the man of sinful life. But what He has to say is not theological, it is spiritual; and right there lies the weight of my argument. Spiritual truths cannot be received in the ordinary way of nature. \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned\" (1 Cor. 2:14). So wrote the apostle Paul to the believers at Corinth. Our Lord referred to this kind of Spirit-enlightened knowledge many times. To Him it was the fruit of a divine illumination, not contrary to but altogether beyond mere intellectual light. The fourth Gospel is full of this idea; indeed the idea is so important to the understanding of John\'s Gospel that anyone who denies it might as well give up trying to grasp our Lord\'s teachings as given by the apostle John. And the same idea is found in John\'s first epistle, making that epistle extremely difficult to understand but also making it one of the most beautiful and rewarding of all the epistles of the New Testament when its teachings are spiritually discerned. The necessity for spiritual illumination before we can grasp spiritual truths is taught throughout the entire New Testament and is altogether in accord with the teachings of the Psalms, the Proverbs and the Prophets. The Old Testament Apocrypha agrees with the Scriptures here, and while the Apocryphal books are not to be received as divinely inspired, they are useful as showing how the best minds of ancient Israel thought about this matter of divine truth and how it is received into the human heart.',' 1 Corinthians 2:14',' Whoever does not have the Spirit cannot receive the gifts that come from God\'s Spirit. Such a person really does not understand them; they are nonsense to him, because their value can be judged only on a spiritual basis (TEV).',' Those outside of Christ are unable to grasp spiritual truth. Only by means of the Holy Spirit is spiritual truth discerned. If we better understood this we would give far greater priority to prayer than to clever presentations.',' Father, often I am satisfied with an intellectual grasp of Your Word when it is the spiritual understanding of it that matters. And You have given Your Spirit to enlighten me.'),(531,'That Incredible Christian',' Sixteen',' The Need for Divine Illumination','53','The Great Illuminator','The New Testament draws a sharp line between the natural mind and the mind that has been touched by divine fire. When Peter made his good confession, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God\" (Matt. 16:16), our Lord replied, \"Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven\" (16:17). And Paul expresses much the same thing when he says, \"No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost\" (1 Cor. 12:3). The sum of what I am saying is that there is an illumination, divinely bestowed, without which theological truth is information and nothing more. While this illumination is never given apart from theology, it is entirely possible to have theology without the illumination. This results in what has been called \"dead orthodoxy,\" and while there may be some who deny that it is possible to be both orthodox and dead at the same time I am afraid experience proves that it is. Revivals, as they have appeared at various times among the churches of the past, have been essentially a quickening of the spiritual life of persons already orthodox. The revivalist, as long as he exercised his ministry as a revivalist, did not try to teach doctrine. His one object was to bring about a quickening of the churches which while orthodox in creed were devoid of spiritual life. When he went beyond this he was something else than a revivalist. Revival can come only to those who know truth. When the inner meaning of familiar doctrines suddenly flashes in upon the heart of a Christian the revival for him has already begun. It may go on to be much more than this but it can never be less.','Luke 24:45','Then he [Jesus] opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.','As Jesus opened the minds of His disciples in order that they might understand the scriptures, so the Holy Spirit does today, illuminating spiritual truth. We don\'t have to stumble in darkness!','You, Holy Spirit, are the Divine Illuminator. Open my heart and mind to see and then obey.'),(532,'That Incredible Christian',' Seventeen',' Truth Has Two Wings','54',' Unused Truth','Lack of balance in the Christian life is often the direct consequence of overemphasis on certain favorite texts, with a corresponding underemphasis on other related ones. For it is not denial only that makes a truth void; failure to emphasize it will in the long run be equally damaging. And this puts us in the odd position of holding a truth theoretically while we make it of no effect by neglecting it in practice. Unused truth becomes as useless as an unused muscle. Sometimes our dogmatic insistence upon \"It is written\" and our refusal to hear \"Again it is written\" makes heretics of us, our heresy being the noncreedal variety which does not rouse the opposition of the theologians. One example of this is the teaching that crops up now and again having to do with confession of sin. It goes like this: Christ died for our sins, not only for all we have committed but for all we may yet commit for the remainder of our lives. When we accept Christ we receive the benefit of everything He did for us in His dying and rising again. In Christ all our current sins are forgiven beforehand. It is therefore unnecessary for us to confess our sins. In Christ they are already forgiven. Now, this is completely wrong, and it is all the more wrong because it is half right. It is true that Christ died for all our sins, but it is not true that because Christ died for all our sins we need not confess that we have sinned when we have. This conclusion does not follow from that premise.',' Psalm 32:5','Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my inquity. I said, \"I will confess my transgressions to the LORD\"—and you forgave the guilt of my sin.','Confessing sin is openly and explicitly acknowledging it before God. No denying or redefining or otherwise trying to hide sin. Confession expresses repentance. When we confess, because of Christ\'s sin-debt payment on our behalf, God forgives!','Oh thank You, Lord, for forgiving and cleansing me as I confess my sin to You. Now, strengthen me to continue to turn from it.'),(533,'That Incredible Christian',' Seventeen',' Truth Has Two Wings','55',' Prevailing Prayer',' It is written that Christ died for our sins, and again it is written that \"if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins\" (1 John 1:9). These two texts are written of the same company of persons, namely Christians. We dare not compel the first text to invalidate the second. Both are true and one completes the other. The meaning of the two is that since Christ died for our sins if we confess our sins they will be forgiven. To teach otherwise is to attempt to fly on one wing. I have met some who claim that it is wrong to pray for the same thing twice, the reason being that if we truly believe when we pray we have the answer the first time; any second prayer betrays the unbelief of the first; ergo, let there be no second prayer. There are three things wrong with this teaching. One is that it ignores a large body of Scripture; the second is that it rarely works in practice, even for the saintliest soul; and the third is that, if persisted in, it robs the praying man of two of his mightiest weapons in his warfare with the flesh and the devil, viz., intercession and petition. For let it be said without qualification that the effective intercessor is never a one-prayer man, neither does the successful petitioner win his mighty victories in his first attempt. Had David subscribed to the one-prayer creed he could have reduced his psalms to about one-third their present length. Elijah would not have prayed seven times for rain (and incidentally, there would have been no rain, either), our Lord would not have prayed the third time saying the same words, nor would Paul have \"besought the Lord thrice\" (2 Cor. 12:8) for the removal of his thorn. In fact, if this teaching were true, much wonderful Biblical narrative would have to be rewritten, for the Bible has much to say about continued and persistent prayer.',' Luke 18:1',' Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.',' Wrote George Mueller: \"It is not enough to begin to pray, nor to pray aright; nor is it enough to continue for a time to pray; but we must patiently, believingly, continue in prayer until we obtain an answer.\"',' Teach me to pray, Lord. Teach me to faithfully keep on prevailingly praying in faith. Deliver me from seeking quick, easy answers.'),(534,'That Incredible Christian',' Seventeen',' Truth Has Two Wings','56',' Using Both Wings',' Truth is like a bird; it cannot fly on one wing. Yet we are forever trying to take off with one wing flapping furiously and the other tucked neatly out of sight. Many of the doctrinal divisions among the churches are the result of a blind and stubborn insistence that truth has but one wing. Each side holds tenaciously to one text, refusing grimly to acknowledge the validity of the other. This error is an evil among churches, but it is a real tragedy when it gets into the hearts of individual Christians and begins to affect their devotional lives. One thing hidden in such teachings as have been mentioned above is unconscious spiritual pride. The Christian who refuses to confess sin on the ground that it is already forgiven is setting himself above prophet and psalmist and all the saints who have left anything on record about themselves from Paul to the present time. These did not hide their sins behind a syllogism, but eagerly and fully confessed them. Perhaps that is why they were such great souls and those who claim to have found a better way are so small. And one has but to note the smug smile of superiority on the face of the one-prayer Christian to sense that there is a lot of pride behind the smile. While other Christians wrestle with God in an agony of intercession they sit back in humble pride waiting it out. They do not pray because they have already prayed. The devil has no fear of such Christians. He has already won over them, and his technique has been false logic. Let\'s use both wings. We\'ll get further that way.',' 1 Timothy 4:16',' Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.',' Emphasis on certain aspects of truth to the neglect of others causes unbalanced living and teaching. We can see it through the history of the Church and even today. Are we using both wings?',' Father, give me breadth as well as depth of understanding of Your truth. Particularly do I need this in relating to other members of Your family who come from traditions other than mine.'),(535,'That Incredible Christian',' Eighteen',' Our Unclaimed Riches','57','Claiming All That Is Ours in Christ','Those spiritual blessings in heavenly places which are ours in Christ may be divided into three classes: The first is those which come to us immediately upon our believing unto salvation, such as forgiveness, justification, regeneration, sonship to God and baptism into the Body of Christ. In Christ we possess these even before we know that they are ours, such knowledge coming to us later through the study of the Holy Scriptures. The second class is those riches which are ours by inheritance but which we cannot enjoy in actuality until our Lord returns. These include ultimate mental and moral perfection, the glorification of our bodies, the completion of the restoration of the divine image in our redeemed personalities and the admission into the very presence of God to experience forever the Beatific Vision. These treasures are as surely ours as if we possessed them now, but it would be useless for us to pray for them while we journey here below. God has made it very clear that they are reserved for the time of the manifestation of the sons of God (Rom. 8:18-25). The third class of blessing consists of spiritual treasures which are ours by blood atonement but which will not come to us unless we make a determined effort to possess them. These are deliverance from the sins of the flesh, victory over self, the constant flow of the Holy Spirit through our personalities, fruitfulness in Christian service, awareness of the presence of God, growth in grace, an increasing consciousness of union with God and an unbroken spirit of worship. These do not come to us automatically nor must we wait to claim them at the day of Christ\'s coming. They are to us what the Promised Land was to Israel, to be entered into as our faith and courage mount.','Ephesians 1:3','Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blesising in Christ.','What immense spiritual wealth is ours in Christ! Some to experience today and some tomorrow. Some which is ours because of spiritual birth as a child of God. Some to be experienced only by deliberate faith appropriation.','Forgive me, Father, for living in spiritual poverty when You have provided such blessings. I want to experience them all, that I may be what You desire me to be.'),(536,'That Incredible Christian',' Eighteen',' Our Unclaimed Riches','58','Claiming All That Is Ours in Christ','The third class of blessing consists of spiritual treasures which are ours by blood atonement but which will not come to us unless we make a determined effort to possess them. To make things clearer let me set forth four propositions touching this heritage of joy which God has set before us: 1. You will get nothing unless you go after it. God will not force anything on you. As Joshua fought his way into possession of the Promised Land you also must fight on toward perfection, meeting and defeating whatever enemies would stand in the way to challenge your right of possession. The land will not come to you; you must go to the land and on up into it by the way of self-renunciation and detachment from the world. \"Those who travel on this road,\" says John of the Cross, \"will meet many occasions of joys and sufferings, hopes and sorrows, some of which are the result of the spirit of perfection, others of imperfection.\" 2. You may have as much as you insist upon having. \"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you\" (Josh. 1:3) said God to Joshua, and this principle runs throughout the entire Bible. The history of Israel is dotted with stories of those who pressed boldly on to claim their possessions; such, for instance, as Caleb who, after the conquest of Canaan, went to Joshua, demanded the mountain Moses had promised him, and got it. Again, when the daughters of Zelophehad stood before Moses and pleaded, \"Give unto us . . . a possession among the brethren of our father\" (Num. 27:4) their request was granted. Those women received their inheritance, not by the indulgence of Moses but by the command of God whose promise was involved. When our requests are such as honor God we may ask as largely as we will. The more daring the request the more glory accrues to God when the answer comes.','Matthew 7:7-8','Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.','We may be asking but are we seeking and knocking? God delights to give to the one who will receive. Ask, seek and knock. There is an intensity, a deep desire to see the door open; to claim all that is ours in Christ.','Father, when I ask for bread You will not give me a stone. You delight in opening to me the treasures in Christ when I ask, seek and knock. May my spiritual knuckles bleed!'),(537,'That Incredible Christian',' Eighteen',' Our Unclaimed Riches','59','Wants or Wishes','The third class of blessing consists of spiritual treasures which are ours by blood atonement but which will not come to us unless we make a determined effort to possess them. To make things clearer let me set forth four propositions touching this heritage of joy which God has set before us; 3. You will have as little as you are satisfied with. God giveth to all men liberally, but it would be absurd to think that God\'s liberality will make a man more godly than he wants to be. The man, for instance, who is satisfied to live a defeated life will never be forced to take victory. The man who is content to follow Christ afar off will never know the radiant wonder of His nearness. The man who is willing to settle for a joyless, barren life will never experience the joy of the Holy Spirit or the deep satisfaction of fruitful living. It is disheartening to those who care, and surely a great grief to the Spirit, to see how many Christians are content to settle for less than the best. Personally I have for years carried a burden of sorrow as I have moved among evangelical Christians who somewhere in their past have managed to strike a base compromise with their heart\'s holier longings and have settled down to a lukewarm, mediocre kind of Christianity utterly unworthy of themselves and of the Lord they claim to serve. And such are found everywhere. 4. You now have as much as you really want. Every man is as close to God as he wants to be; he is as holy and as full of the Spirit as he wills to be. Our Lord said, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled\" (Matt. 5:6). If there were but one man anywhere on earth who hungered and was not filled the word of Christ would fall to the ground. Yet we must distinguish wanting from wishing. By \"want\" I mean wholehearted desire. Certainly there are many who wish they were holy or victorious or joyful but are not willing to meet God\'s conditions to obtain. That God has placed before His redeemed children a vast world of spiritual treasures and that they refuse or neglect to claim it may easily turn out to be the second greatest tragedy in the history of the moral creation, the first and greatest being the fall of man.','Ephesians 5:8','For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.','We are to live as children of light because we are light in the Lord. The \"living\" is our part. The \"enabling\" is His. Let\'s not be satisfied with little when He provides so much.','O Lord, give me a consuming discontent with spiritual poverty! I am a child of the King of kings and the Lord of lords and so I may live.'),(538,'That Incredible Christian',' Nineteen',' Living the God-Conscious Life','60','Beholding His Glory','It is true that a select company of Christians through the centuries have testified that they were rapt into a state where for varying lengths of time they were able to experience the Beatific Vision at least to some degree while still here in their natural bodies, seeing the everblessed One not with their physical eyes but with the eye of the Spirit. Being myself extremely cautious and slow to accept the unusual, I have tended to back away from this burning bush; but the holy characters of some of those who made such claims, their salty good sense and their sound basic theology along with their devoted service to mankind, have certainly placed them above the faintest suspicion of being fanatics or impostors. I for one must accept their testimony as valid. I suppose the vast majority of us must wait for the great day of the Lord\'s coming to realize the full wonder of the vision of God Most High. In the meantime, we are, I believe, missing a great measure of radiant glory that is ours by blood-covenant and available to us in this present world if we would but believe it and press on in the way of holiness. In seeking to know God better we must keep firmly in mind that we need not try to persuade God. He is already persuaded in our favor, not by our prayers but by the generous goodness of His own heart. \"It is God\'s nature to give Himself to every virtuous soul,\" says Meister Eckhart. \"Know then that God is bound to act, to pour Himself out into thee as soon as ever He shall find thee ready.\" As nature abhors a vacuum, so the Holy Spirit rushes in to fill the nature that has become empty by separating itself from the world and sin. This is not an unnatural act and need not be an unusual one, for it is in perfect accord with the nature of God. He must act as He does because He is God.','2 Corinthians 3:18','And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord\'s glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.','\"Behold\" is probably a preferable translation to that of \"reflect.\" This is the only occurrence of the verb in the New Testament. With unveiled faces we may see as in a mirror the Lord\'s glory. As we do we are being transformed into His likeness. We may','I ask for things and, if I remember, thank You for them. I read Your Word. But, O Lord, to behold You, to spend time beholding Your glory. It is a daily discipline missing in my life. Help me to change!'),(539,'That Incredible Christian',' Nineteen',' Living the God-Conscious Life','61','\"I Am with You Always\"','It is hardly possible to overstress the importance of unceasing inward prayer on the part of the one who would live the God-conscious life. Prayer at stated times is good and right; we will never outgrow the need of it while we remain on earth. But this kind of prayer must be supported and perfected by the habit of constant, unspoken prayer. But someone may question whether in a world like this it is possible to think of God constantly. Would it not be too great a burden to try to keep God constantly in the focus of our minds while carrying on our normal activities in this noisy and highly complex civilization? Francois Malaval had the answer to this: \"The wings of the dove do not weigh it down,\" he said. \"They carry and support it. And so the thought of God is never a burden; it is a gentle breeze which bears us up, a hand which supports us and raises us, a light which guides us, and a spirit which vivifies us though we do not feel its working.\" We all know how the presence of someone we deeply love lifts our spirits and suffuses us with a radiant sense of peace and well-being. So the one who loves God supremely is lifted into rapture by His conscious Presence. \"Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord\" (John 20:20). If only we would stop lamenting and look up. God is here. Christ is risen. The Spirit has been poured out from on high. All this we know as theological truth. It remains for us to turn it into joyous spiritual experience. And how is this accomplished? There is no new technique; if it is new it is false. The old, old method still works. Conscious fellowship with Christ is by faith, love and obedience. And the humblest believer need not be without these.','Matthew 28:20b','And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.','He is always with us! As He has been with His people through the ages. As He promised to be wherever two or three gather in His name. He is with us.

There are some truths set forth in the Scriptures that place a great strain upon our minds. Divine revelation assures us that certain things are true which imagination will simply not grasp. We believe them but we cannot see them in the mind\'s eye. It may be pointed out here that the ease with which we grasp a truth is sure to be in exact proportion to its externality as distinguished from its internality. Biblical history, for instance, because it is all objective and external, is no problem to belief. We are sure we believe whatever is written about Moses or David or Peter because we have no trouble \"seeing\" it taking place, while such truths as regeneration or the divine indwelling cannot be visualized and so are more difficult for us to handle. This we should recognize as psychological, not spiritual, and stop chiding ourselves for something we have not done.','Mark 9:24','Immediately the boy\'s father exclaimed, \"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\"','Alexander Whyte considered imagination \"the noblest intellectual attribute of the human mind.\" By it we may identify with Christ, with the heroes and failures of the biblical record.

To be contented and unafraid when going on a journey with his father the child need not be able to imagine events; he need but know the father. Our earthly lives are one shining web of golden mystery which we experience without understanding, how much more our life in the Spirit. Jesus Christ is our all in all. We need but trust Him and He will take care of the rest. Possibly it is because of my own innate dullness that I have found such deep satisfaction in these words of the prophet: \"I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them\" (Isa. 42:16).

Though this is seldom presented to Christians as a fact of life it is a very solid fact indeed as every experienced Christian knows, and one we shall learn how to handle or stumble over to our own undoing. Satan hates the true Christian for several reasons. One is that God loves him, and whatever is loved by God is sure to be hated by the devil. Another is that the Christian, being a child of God, bears a family resemblance to the Father and to the household of faith. Satan\'s ancient jealousy has not abated nor his hatred for God diminished in the slightest. Whatever reminds him of God is without other reason the object of his malignant hate. A third reason is that a true Christian is a former slave who has escaped from the galley, and Satan cannot forgive him for this affront. A fourth reason is that a praying Christian is a constant threat to the stability of Satan\'s government. The Christian is a holy rebel loose in the world with access to the throne of God. Satan never knows from what direction the danger will come. Who knows when another Elijah will arise, or another Daniel? or a Luther or a Booth? Who knows when an Edwards or a Finney may go in and liberate a whole town or countryside by the preaching of the Word and prayer? Such a danger is too great to tolerate, so Satan gets to the new convert as early as possible to prevent his becoming too formidable a foe.','1 Peter 5:8-9','Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith.','In case you haven\'t noticed, you are not popular with Satan! Why? You are an object of God\'s love; part of God\'s family; an escaped prisoner of the evil one and a danger to him.','In You I stand, Lord. In myself I am easy prey for Satan. In You I am strong. Praise Your name!'),(543,'That Incredible Christian',' Twenty-one',' The Christian Life Is Not Easy','65',' Those Museum Pieces',' Now I do not think that Satan much cares to destroy us Christians physically. The soldier dead in battle who died performing some deed of heroism is not a great loss to the army but may rather be an object of pride to his country. On the other hand the soldier who cannot or will not fight but runs away at the sound of the first enemy gun is a shame to his family and a disgrace to his nation. So a Christian who dies in the faith represents no irreparable loss to the forces of righteousness on earth and certainly no victory for the devil. But when whole regiments of professed believers are too timid to fight and too smug to be ashamed, surely it must bring an astringent smile to the face of the enemy; and it should bring a blush to the cheeks of the whole Church of Christ. The devil\'s master strategy for us Christians then is not to kill us physically (though there may be some special situations where physical death fits into his plan better), but to destroy our power to wage spiritual warfare. And how well he has succeeded. The average Christian these days is a harmless enough thing. God knows. He is a child wearing with considerable self-consciousness the harness of the warrior; he is a sick eaglet that can never mount up with wings; he is a spent pilgrim who has given up the journey and sits with a waxy smile trying to get what pleasure he can from sniffing the wilted flowers he has plucked by the way. Such as these have been reached. Satan has gotten to them early. By means of false teaching or inadequate teaching, or the huge discouragement that comes from the example of a decadent church, he has succeeded in weakening their resolution, neutralizing their convictions and taming their original urge to do exploits; now they are little more than statistics that contribute financially to the upkeep of the religious institution. And how many a pastor is content to act as a patient, smiling curator of a church full (or a quarter full) of such blessed spiritual museum pieces.',' 1 Corinthians 16:13',' Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage; be strong.',' We are warriors not spectators. We are on active duty not on furlough. Some of us seem to be singing: \"backward Christian soldiers, fleeing from all war; drop the cross of Jesus, live just as before.\"',' Father, in myself I am careless, fearful and weak. I don\'t want to be a museum piece. Only in Christ can I be strong and stand firm. Only in Him.'),(544,'That Incredible Christian',' Twenty-one',' The Christian Life Is Not Easy','66',' Victors or Victims',' If Satan opposes the new convert he opposes still more bitterly the Christian who is pressing on toward a higher life in Christ. The Spirit-filled life is not, as many suppose, a life of peace and quiet pleasure. It is likely to be something quite the opposite. Viewed one way it is a pilgrimage through a robber-infested forest; viewed another, it is a grim warfare with the devil. Always there is struggle, and sometimes there is a pitched battle with our own nature where the lines are so confused that it is all but impossible to locate the enemy or to tell which impulse is of the Spirit and which of the flesh. There is complete victory for us if we will but take the way of the triumphant Christ, but that is not what we are considering now. My point here is that if we want to escape the struggle we have but to draw back and accept the currently accepted low-keyed Christian life as the normal one. That is all Satan wants. That will ground our power, stunt our growth and render us harmless to the kingdom of darkness. Compromise will take the pressure off. Satan will not bother a man who has quit fighting. But the cost of quitting will be a life of peaceful stagnation. We sons of eternity just cannot afford such a thing.',' Ephesians 6:10-11',' Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil\'s schemes.',' Unmistakably clear from scripture is the fact that as believers we are in warfare. God has provided armor, weaponry and strength for the battle (Eph. 6:10-18). It remains for us to use it! Otherwise we are in danger of becoming POWs.',' O Lord, I want to be strong in You. Thank You for the armor and weaponry with which You have equipped me. I go today in Your strength.'),(545,'That Incredible Christian',' Twenty-two',' Affirmation and Denial','67',' Accepting Christ Means Rejecting All Else',' The notion that we enter the Christian life by an act of acceptance is true, but that is not all the truth. There is much more to it than that. Christianity involves an acceptance and a repudiation, an affirmation and a denial. And this not only at the moment of conversion but continually thereafter day by day in all the battle of life till the great conflict is over and the Christian is home from the wars. To live a life wholly positive is, fortunately, impossible. Were any man able to do such a thing it could be only for a moment. Living positively would be like inhaling continuously without exhaling. Aside from its being impossible, it would be fatal. Exhalation is as necessary to life as inhalation. To accept Christ it is necessary that we reject whatever is contrary to Him. This is a fact often overlooked by eager evangelists bent on getting results. Like the salesman who talks up the good points of his product and conceals its disadvantages, the badly informed soulwinner stresses the positive side of things at the expense of the negative.',' Luke 16:13',' No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.',' To accept Christ as Lord is to reject all else. We cannot accept His Saviorhood and deny His Lordship. It is Christ the Lord who is Savior.',' In turning to You there is inevitably that from which I turn. Show me, Lord, that baggage and stuff I am trying to drag along in following You. For Jesus\' sake.'),(546,'That Incredible Christian',' Twenty-two',' Affirmation and Denial','68',' Unseen Realities',' Let us not be shocked by the suggestion that there are disadvantages to the life in Christ. There most certainly are. Abel was murdered. Joseph was sold into slavery, Daniel was thrown into the den of lions, Stephen was stoned to death, Paul was beheaded, and a noble army of martyrs was put to death by various painful methods down the long centuries. And where the hostility did not lead to such violence (and mostly it did not and does not) the sons of this world nevertheless managed to make it tough for the children of God in a thousand cruel ways. Everyone who has lived for Christ in a Christless world has suffered some losses and endured some pains that he could have avoided by the simple expedient of laying down his cross. However, the pains are short and the losses inconsequential compared with the glory that will follow, \"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory\" (2 Cor. 4:17). But while we are here among men with our sensitive hearts exposed to the chilly blasts of the unbelieving and uncomprehending world it is imperative that we take a realistic view of things and learn how to deal with disadvantages. And it is important that we tell the whole truth to those we are endeavoring to win.',' 2 Corinthians 4:17-18',' For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.',' Our present troubles are light and temporary when compared to the glory eternal and as yet unseen. In the momentary in which we are now living let\'s fix our eyes on the unseen. It is the unseen that is far more real than that which is now seen.',' Lord, help me develop the discipline to look up from present pain and suffering which shall pass to the coming glory which is eternal.'),(547,'That Incredible Christian',' Twenty-two',' Affirmation and Denial','69',' Daily Cross-carrying','Our Lord called men to follow Him but He never made the way look easy. Indeed one gets the distinct impression that He made it appear extremely hard. Sometimes He said things to disciples or prospective disciples that we today discreetly avoid repeating when we are trying to win men to Him. What present-day evangelist would have the courage to tell an inquirer, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it\" (Matt. 16:24-25)? And do not we do some tall explaining when someone asks us what Jesus meant when He said, \"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law\" (Matt. 10:34-35)? That kind of rugged, sinewy Christianity is left for an occasional missionary or for some believer behind one of the various curtains in the world. The masses of professed Christians simply do not have the moral muscle to enable them to take a path so downright and final as this. When will Christians learn that to love righteousness it is necessary to hate sin? that to accept Christ it is necessary to reject self? that to follow the good way we must flee from evil? that a friend of the world is an enemy of God? that God allows no twilight zone between two altogethers where the fearful and the doubting may take refuge at once from hell to come and the rigors of present discipline?',' Luke 9:23','If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.','Ever wonder why we experience such difficulty in trying to follow Christ? Perhaps we have neglected to take up our cross daily—that cross which is the instrument of death to self.','By Your Spirit, Lord, remind me to carry my cross today. I want to follow Christ.'),(548,'That Incredible Christian',' Twenty-three',' The Giver and the Taker','70',' Unlimited Resources but Limited Receptacles',' Since God is infinite, whatever He is must be infinite also; that is, it must be without any actual or conceivable limits. The moment we allow ourselves to think of God as having limits, the one of whom we are thinking is not God but someone or something less than and different from Him. To think rightly of God we must conceive of Him as being altogether boundless in His goodness, mercy, love, grace and in whatever else we may properly attribute to the Deity. It is not enough that we acknowledge God\'s infinite resources; we must believe also that He is infinitely generous to bestow them. The first is not too great a strain on our faith. Even the deist will admit that the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth, must be rich beyond the power of man to conceive. But to believe that God is a giver as well as a possessor takes an advanced faith and presupposes that there has been a divine revelation to that effect which gives validity to our expectations. Which indeed there has been. We call this revelation the Bible. Believing all this, why are we Christians so poverty stricken? I think it is because we have not learned that God\'s gifts are meted out according to the taker, not according to the giver. Though almighty and all-wise, God yet cannot pour a great gift into a small receptacle.',' Luke 6:38-39',' Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.',' God gives and gives and gives. No matter how much we receive there is still more to be received. If we would only give and empty ourselves of the junk that clutters, we may reach out to take more from Him.',' Oh to be an empty vessel to aggressively receive all that You, O Lord, give.'),(549,'That Incredible Christian',' Twenty-three',' The Giver and the Taker','71',' Growing Faith and Increasing Capacity',' To receive in a measure more in keeping with God\'s liberality five things are necessary. The first is faith. We must be convinced that God is kind, generous, goodhearted and ready to bestow His blessings upon His people with the bounty of a king. To have faith we must immerse ourselves in the Scriptures. And faith must be exercised if it is to be effective. Faith, like a muscle, grows by stretching. The second is capacity. That we differ from each other in spiritual capacity is too evident to need proof; but the reason is a great mystery and lies too deep for our understanding, certainly too deep for discussion here. It is enough to say that whatever his capacity each man can increase it if he will. The human soul is not a hard-baked vessel with a fixed size; it is a living thing capable of growth and expansion as it interacts with the gracious actions of the Holy Spirit.',' Luke 17:5',' The apostles said to the Lord, \"Increase our faith!\"',' Exercising faith increases it. Exercising faith opens our soul\'s door to receive from God and increases our capacity to receive.',' Lord, I can\'t ask You to increase my faith until I am ready to exercise what faith I already have.'),(550,'That Incredible Christian',' Twenty-three',' The Giver and the Taker','72','Thankfully Receiving and Responsibly Using','To receive in a measure more in keeping with God\'s liberality five things are necessary. The third is receptivity, and one factor always present in receptivity is interest. It is virtually impossible to receive into our minds anything in which we have no interest. A man of ordinary mind may go on to do marvels in a given field if he has keen enough interest in it, and leave behind many men of finer minds who lack the necessary interest. Sometimes one interest may crowd out another. I wonder how many potential Rubensteins or Heifetzes may have gotten lost in obscurity simply because they could not as boys bring themselves to practice when a ball game was in progress on a corner lot nearby. So worldly interests often crowd out heavenly ones and spiritual receptivity is destroyed as a result. The fourth is responsibility. The gifts of God are given to us to use. When they are not used they atrophy. The story of the ten talents should be a warning to all of us. When writing about the gifts of the Spirit the apostle Paul explained that these manifestations of the Spirit were given to everyone for the profit of all. Selfish attitudes toward the blessings of God can destroy their usefulness. We have a serious responsibility in this matter. The fifth is gratitude. It is impossible to be too thankful to God, but it might be good to try it. Our wise Father does not usually give a second gift until we properly praise Him for the first.','Romans 8:32','He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?','He gives abundantly. Let\'s receive with thanksgiving and use what He gives for His glory.','Forgive me, Father, for my frequent thanklessness. I want to receive all that You graciously give. And I want to use it for Your glory!'),(551,'That Incredible Christian','24','There Is No Substitute for Theology','73','If God Is','We being what we are and all things else being what they are, the most important and profitable study any of us can engage in is without question the study of theology. That theology probably receives less attention than any other subject tells us nothing about its importance or lack of it. It indicates rather that men are still hiding from the presence of God among the trees of the garden and feel acutely uncomfortable when the matter of their relation to God is brought up. They sense their deep alienation from God and only manage to live at peace with themselves by forgetting that they are not at peace with God. If there were no God, things would be quite otherwise with us. Were there no one to whom we must finally render up account, at least one big load would be gone from our minds. We would only need to live within the law, not too hard a task in most countries, and there would be nothing to fear. But if God indeed created the earth and placed man upon it in a state of moral probation, then the heavy obligation lies upon us to learn the will of God and do it.','John 17:26','I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.','If God is, who is He? What is He like? How do I relate to Him? What is His will? Foolish questions if God isn\'t. But if He is I must know all I can about Him — that becomes my theology.','Lord, without You there is no reason for me to be and nothing for me beyond death. But You are! Through Your Son, You and Your love are made known. Thank You!'),(552,'That Incredible Christian','24',' There Is No Substitute for Theology','74','No Morality Without God','It has always seemed to me completely inconsistent that existentialism should deny the existence of God and then proceed to use the language of theism to persuade men to live right. The French writer, Jean-Paul Sartre, for instance, states frankly that he represents atheistic existentialism. “If God does not exist,” he says, “we find no values or commands to turn to which legitimize our conduct. So in the bright realm of values, we have no excuse behind us, nor justification before us. We are all alone, with no excuses.” Yet in the next paragraph he states bluntly, “Man is responsible for his passion,” and further on, “A coward is responsible for his cowardice.” And such considerations as these, he says, fill the existentialist with “anguish, forlornness and despair.” It seems to me that such reasoning must assume the truth of everything it seeks to deny. If there were no God there would be no such words as “responsible.” No criminal need fear a judge who does not exist; nor would he need to worry about breaking a law that had not been passed. It is the knowledge that the law and the judge do in fact exist that strikes fear to the lawbreaker’s heart. There is someone to whom he is accountable; otherwise the concept of responsibility could have no meaning.','Psalm 14:1','The fool says in his heart, \'there is no God.\' . . .','Without God there is no right or wrong, good or bad. Somehow we have evolved from something causeless. Why are we here and for what purpose? There is no answer for the one who has said in his or her heart, \"There is no God.\"','O God, You are! Father, Son and Holy Spirit. I worship You and give thanks to You.'),(553,'That Incredible Christian','24',' There Is No Substitute for Theology','75','The Study of God','It is precisely because God is, and because man is made in His image and is accountable to Him, that theology is so critically important. Christian revelation alone has the answer to life’s unanswered questions about God and human destiny. To let these authoritative answers lie neglected while we search everywhere else for answers and find none is, it seems to me, nothing less than folly. No motorist would be excused if he neglected to consult his road map and tried instead to find his way across the country by looking for moss on logs, or by observing the flight of wild bees or watching the movements of the heavenly bodies. If there were no map a man might find his way by the stars; but for a traveler trying to get home the stars would be a poor substitute for a map. Without a map the Greeks did an admirable piece of navigating; but the Hebrews possessed the map and so had no need of human philosophy. As one not wholly unacquainted with Greek thought I state it is my belief that but one of Isaiah’s eloquent chapters or David’s inspired psalms contains more real help for mankind than all the output of the finest minds of Greece during the centuries of her glory.','Colossians 3:2-3','Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.','Theology is the study of God. It reveals who I am and who I can become because of who God is, what He has done and what He continues to do.','Open my eyes, Lord, open my mind to grasp more of who You are and who I am in You.

Let the cares of life crowd out the Scriptures from my mind and I have suffered loss where I can least afford it. Let me accept anything else instead of the Scriptures and I have been cheated and robbed to my eternal confusion. The secret of life is theological and the key to heaven as well. We learn with difficulty, forget easily and suffer many distractions. Therefore we should set our hearts to study theology. We should preach it from our pulpits, sing it in our hymns, teach it to our children and make it the subject of conversation when we meet with Christian friends.',' John 17:3',' Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.',' The secret of life is not only knowing about God but knowing Him.

This is because of who God is and who and what man is. God is the essence of intelligent, self-conscious life and man is created in His image. God is love, and man is made for God. God and man exist for each other and neither is satisfied without the other. Though God is self-sufficient He has sovereignly willed to have communion with the being He made in honor next to Himself, and He takes every means to secure this communion short of coercion, which would be a violation of man’s free will. Were God to override our wills He would be forcing Himself upon us and by so doing would make us a little less than human and so a little less than the being He made for Himself.','2 Corinthians 6:16c',' . . . As God has said: \"I will be their God and they shall be my people.\"','By creating us in His image, God has opened to us the possibility of communion with Him. Through Christ we may experience God. It is an option we exercise, reject or just neglect.','Lord, You have made me so that I may experience You. Teach me to walk with You.'),(556,'That Incredible Christian','25',' The Increasing Knowledge of God','78',' Rejecting Our Option to Experience God',' That first picture of God and man at the time of the creation shows them in close and openhearted communion. Adam listens while God explains how it is to be with him in his Eden home and lays down a few easy rules for his life on the earth. The whole scene is restful, relaxed and altogether beautiful. But the communion did not last. Adam’s very likeness to God, viz., his freedom to choose, permitted him, though it did not compel him, to make a choice contrary to the will of God. So sin entered and the wondrous fellowship was broken. Seen from our human standpoint redemption must rank first among all the acts of God. No other achievement of the Godhead required such vast and precise knowledge, such perfection of wisdom or such fullness of moral power. To bring man into communion with Himself God must deal effectively with the whole matter of justice and righteousness; He must dispose of sin, reconcile an enemy and make a rebel willingly obedient. And this He must do without compromising His holiness or coercing the race He would save.',' Genesis 3:8',' Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.',' Adam and Eve rejected their option to experience God. They exercised their God-given freedom to turn away from God. We have all inherited their \"spiritual DNA.\" We choose sin and darkness. In Christ God calls us to come to Him, to know Him.',' O God, how often have I exercised the freedom You have given me to turn away from You to sin. That freedom I now use to flee to You and life in Christ!'),(557,'That Incredible Christian','25',' The Increasing Knowledge of God','79',' Christ Our Mediator','How two wills set in opposition to each other, and both free, could be harmonized was God’s problem and His alone; and with infinite wisdom and power He solved it through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ our Lord. Because Christ is God and man He can properly represent each before the other. He is the Daysman who can stand between the alienated man and the offended God and lay His hand upon them both. “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 2:5) . All this is such a familiar part of evangelical theology that it may safely be assumed that the majority of my readers know it already. That is, they know it theoretically, but the experiential aspect of the truth is not so well known. Indeed large numbers of supposedly sound Christian believers know nothing at all about personal communion with God; and there lies one of the greatest weaknesses of present-day Christianity.',' 1 Timothy 2:5','For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men—the testimony given in its proper time.','Christ mediates between God and us. He draws us to God who wants all to be saved. Christ has done this by giving Himself as our ransom. You and I may know God!

I want to know You, intimately know You!'),(558,'That Incredible Christian','25',' The Increasing Knowledge of God','80',' Determining to Know God',' The experiential knowledge of God is eternal life (John 17:3), and increased knowledge results in a correspondingly larger and fuller life. So rich a treasure is this inward knowledge of God that every other treasure is as nothing compared with it. We may count all things of no value and sacrifice them freely if we may thereby gain a more perfect knowledge of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. This was Paul’s testimony (Phil. 3:7-14) and it has been the testimony of all great Christian souls who have followed Christ from Paul’s day to ours. To know God it is necessary that we be like God to some degree, for things wholly dissimilar cannot agree and beings wholly unlike can never have communion with each other. It is necessary therefore that we use every means of grace to bring our souls into harmony with the character of God.',' 2 Peter 3:18',' But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.',' Growing in the grace and knowledge of Christ is not automatic. We must make it the foremost life priority.

Thou oughtest always then to keep thine heart in peace, that thou mayest keep pure that temple of God, and with a right and pure intention thou art to work, pray, obey, and suffer, without being in the least disturbed, whatever it pleases the Lord to send unto thee.” To enjoy this growing knowledge of God will require that we go beyond the goals so casually set by modern evangelicals. We must fix our hearts on God and purposefully aim to rise above the dead level and average of current Christianity. If we do this Satan will surely tempt us by accusing us of spiritual pride and our friends will warn us to beware of being “holier than thou.” But as the land of promise had to be taken by storm against the determined opposition of the enemy, so we must capture new spiritual heights over the sour and violent protests of the devil. As we move farther up into the knowledge of Christ we open new areas of our beings to attack, but what of it? Remember that spiritual complacency is more deadly than anything the devil can bring against us in our upward struggle. If we sit still to escape temptation, then we are being tempted worse than before and gaining nothing by it. “Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount . . . Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land” (Deut. 1:6, 8).',' Philippians 3:12',' Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect,but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.',' Christ Jesus took hold of us for what?

All that is good in the world stands as a target for all that is evil and manages to stay alive only by constant watchfulness and the providential protection of Almighty God. As a man or a nation may be in deepest trouble when unaware of any trouble at all and in gravest danger when ignorant that any danger exists, so the church may be in greatest peril by not recognizing the presence of peril or the source from which it comes. The church at Laodicea has stood for nineteen hundred years as a serious warning to the whole church of Christ to be most watchful when no enemy is in sight and to remain poor in spirit when earthly wealth increases, yet we appear to have learned nothing from her. We expound the seven letters to the churches of Asia and then return to our own company to live like the Laodicean church. There is in us a bent to backsliding that is all but impossible to cure.',' Revelation 3:17',' You say, \'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.',' How tragic to think that we are spiritually rich, morally strong and saintly when God sees us as pitiful, poor and blind.

Within and around her are enemies that not only could destroy her, but are meant to and will unless she resists force with yet greater force. The Christian would collapse from sheer external pressure were there not within him a counterpressure sufficiently great to prevent it. The power of the Holy Spirit is, therefore, not optional but necessary. Without it the children of God simply cannot live the life of heaven on earth. The hindrances are too many and too effective. A Church is a living organism and is subject to attack from such enemies as prey on living things. Yet the figure of the human body to stand for the Church is not adequate, for the life of the body is nonintelligent, whereas the Church is composed of moral beings having intelligence to recognize their enemies and a will to enable them to resist. The human body can fight its enemies even while it is asleep, but the Church cannot. She must be awake and determined or she cannot win.',' John 17:14-15',' I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.',' Increasing is the pressure not only to be in the world but of it.

The temptation is strong to reject what we cannot explain, or at least to withhold belief till we have investigated further. This attitude is proper, even commendable, for the scientist, but wholly wrong for the Christian. Here is the reason: The faith of the Christian rests down squarely upon the man Christ Jesus who declares that He is both God and Lord. This claim must be received by pure faith or rejected outright; it can never be proved by investigation. That is why Christ’s appeal is directed to faith alone. The believer thinks, it is true; but he thinks because he believes, not in order that he may. Faith secures from the indwelling Spirit confirmation exquisitely perfect, but only after it is there without other support than Christ Himself.',' 2 Corinthians 5:7',' We live by faith, not by sight.',' It is only by faith we can see the unseen that is the anchor of our belief. We live by faith. But it is faith in Christ!',' O Christ, it is because of who I have found You to be that I walk by faith into the unseen.'),(563,'That Incredible Christian','26',' Resisting the Enemy','85',' Looking Back While Pressing On',' Another enemy is complacency.“ Woe to them that are at ease in Zion” (Amos 6:1). The contended Christian is not in danger of attack, he has already been attacked. He is sick and does not know it. To escape this we must stir up the gift of God which is in us. We must declare war on contentment and press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Again there is self-righteousness. The temptation to feel morally pleased with ourselves will be all the greater as our lives become better. The only sure defense against this is to cultivate a quiet state of continual penitence. A sweet but sobering memory of our past guilt and a knowledge of our present imperfections are not incompatible with the joy of the Lord; and they are of inestimable aid in resisting the enemy.',' Amos 6:1',' Woe to you who are complacent in Zion, and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria, you notable men of the foremost nation, to whom the people of Israel come!\"',' Distorted perspective fuels pride.

Yet the closer I come to You the more exposed is my sinfulness and old-nature living. Gracious Lord, please keep growing me.'),(564,'That Incredible Christian','26',' Resisting the Enemy','86',' Daring to be Different',' The fear of man brings a snare, said the prophet, and this enemy, too, must be defeated. Our whole modern world is geared to destroy individual independence and bring all of us into conformity to all the rest of us. Any deviation from the pattern, whatever that pattern may be at the time, will not be forgiven by society, and since the Christian must deviate radically from the world he naturally comes in for the world’s displeasure. If he surrenders to fear he has been conquered, and he dare not let this happen. Other enemies may be identified, such as love of luxury, secret sympathy with the world, self-confidence, pride and unholy thoughts. These we must resist with every power within us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.',' Isaiah 51:7',' Hear me, you who know what is right, you people who have my law in your hearts: Do not fear the reproach of men or be terrified by their insults.',' How easily concern for what people think pushes aside our awesome reverence for what God thinks. As people of God in this world we are different. But it is sometimes embarassing, even fearful, when others note the difference. It can even be costly. Is it',' O Father, give me courage to be lovingly different for Christ\'s sake.'),(565,'That Incredible Christian','27',' Spiritual Things Must Be Spiritually Discerned','87',' Distinguishing the Spiritual from the Natural',' They who think on heavenly things are forced by their psychological structure to use mental raw material borrowed from the earth. And this is certain to show up in their thinking. Even the Bible, to be understood by its readers, must condescend to tell of eternal things in the language of time. It must explain the celestial by means of the mundane. So we find in the Scriptures birds and kings and sheep and soldiers acting as interpreters for Almighty God. Grapes and lilies, gold and stubble, corn and cattle, rain and stars all are used by the Holy Spirit to carry our minds across the vast chasm that separates the spiritual from the material. Doubtless the constant use of figures drawn from our familiar world to express religious ideas leaves a residuum at the bottom of our minds which in some measure gives color, if not form, to our theology. We struggle to understand spiritual things by comparing them to natural ones; then little by little those natural things become identified with the spiritual completely and the spiritual suffers greatly as a consequence.',' 1 Corinthians 13:12',' Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.',' At best we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror because God reveals to us reality of which we have no experience. He speaks of the unknown in the context of the familiar so that we may grasp truth even imperfectly.',' O Holy Spirit, help me to move beyond the natural to the spiritual to undersstand what for me is the newly revealed.'),(566,'That Incredible Christian','27',' Spiritual Things Must Be Spiritually Discerned','88',' Heart Worship',' One task of the illuminated Christian teacher is to internalize worship and raise the religious concepts of church people above the figures and allegories that enabled them to grasp those concepts in the first place. The figure is the box in which the shining jewel is carried; but it is surprisingly easy to mistake the box for the jewel and look for nothing more. Christianity is the religion of the heart. It searches for and finds the man under his wrappings. The gospel reaches the man under his wrappings. The gospel reaches the man far in where there is nothing to distinguish him from any other man. Whether he is dark or red or white matters not at all; whether he is a Stone Age aborigine in a grass hut or a civilized white man in an air-conditioned office he is the same man underneath, and it is for that man that the Spirit keeps up His persistent search.',' Psalm 95:6-7a',' Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker; for he is our God . . .',' Worship. Heart worship. When our spirit is caught up in awesome wonder in the majesty of God\'s presence. More than emotional uplift more than intellectual loftiness. Rather, recognition that He is God and bowing in spirit before Him. We don\'t know much o',' Teach me to worship, to worship in heart. And use me to help others to so worship You. You are God.'),(567,'That Incredible Christian','27',' Spiritual Things Must Be Spiritually Discerned','89',' Beyond the Shepherd Image',' It would appear obvious enough once we think of it that the image of natural objects treasured in the mind tends to impede the flight of our souls upward into God. Illustrations which, by their very definition, should let in light, if used often and objectified by the artist’s brush, become opaque at last and actually shut out the light they were intended to admit. A familiar example may help me to make my point. The psalmist David, in the most beautiful hymn in the world, teaches us to think of Christ as our Shepherd. The Lord Jesus carried the idea further and talked tenderly of His sheep and of Himself as the Shepherd who should lay down His life for them. The artists took up the idea and depicted Christ as a real shepherd and their work has become so fixed in the minds of Christians that when our Lord returns many of them will be secretly disappointed if He is not carrying a crook in His hand and a woolly lamb under His arm. In this instance what is intended to assist our understanding, to lift our imagination, to put poetry and music into our hearts, has by our blindness become instead a positive hindrance to our knowledge of Christ. Worse, it has given us not only an inadequate but an erroneous picture of Him. We try to visualize Him and the only image that projects onto the screen is that of an idealized shepherd of the Near East, an image which I am certain Paul and John would never recognize. Paul declared that he knew Christ after the flesh no more, and the same John who had recorded the words of Christ concerning the sheep and the shepherd, when he saw Him as He now is fell at His feet as dead.',' Philippians 2:9-11',' Therefore God exalted him to the highest place . . . that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.',' He is our shepherd in all the biblical meaning of that metaphor. But He is the risen Christ, King of kings, Lord of lords at whose name one day every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that He is Lord, to the glory of the Father!',' Open my eyes, Lord, to behold You as You are, within human ability to do so.'),(568,'That Incredible Christian','27',' Spiritual Things Must Be Spiritually Discerned','90',' The Soaring Spirit','Always the Church has been tempted to think of God by the use of images and forms, and always when she has so done she has fallen into externalism and spiritual decay. Some of the greatest books apart from the inspired Scriptures have been written to call the Church back to a purer view of God. Miguel de Molinos, in his Spiritual Guide, insists that prayer is “an ascent or elevation of the mind to God.” “God is above all creatures,” he says further, “and the soul cannot see Him nor converse with Him if she raise not herself above them all.” . . . I think it may be said with a fair degree of accuracy that all the great devotional theologians of the centuries taught the futility of trying to visualize the Godhead. Molinos warned against every effort of the intellect to image God forth. “She ought to go forward with her love,” he says of the Christian’s soul, “leaving all her understanding behind. Let her love God as He is and not as her understanding says He is, and pictures Him.” The teaching of the New Testament is that God and spiritual things can be known finally only by a direct work of God within the soul. However theological knowledge may be aided by figures and analogies, the true understanding of God must be by personal spiritual awareness. The Holy Spirit is indispensable. (See John 14—16:33 and I Corinthians 1:18—2:16.)',' John 4:24','God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.','Intellectual concentration on scripture is necessary to understand truth, to apply it and to communicate it to others. There is also necessary the soaring of the spirit beyond intellectual exercise where our spirit communes with God.','Teach me more of spirit worship, Lord, that in truth and spirit I may worship You.'),(569,'That Incredible Christian','28',' To Be Understood, Truth Must Be Lived','91',' Living the Truth',' For a long time I have believed that truth, to be understood, must be lived; that Bible doctrine is wholly ineffective until it has been digested and assimilated by the total life. I have held this to be an important element in the preaching of the Old Testament prophets, and I have felt it to be near to the heart of the moral teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ. I admit that this belief has made me a little lonely, for not many of my Christian brethren share it with me. While I have not heard anyone deny the truth outright, few have seen fit to teach it with anything approaching emphasis. And by silence a man will reveal his beliefs as surely as by argument. This is one of those truths which at first may appear dull and colorless, but far from being tame or weak, this truth is of tremendous importance to all of us. While not to my knowledge formulated as a tenet in the creed of any church or school of religious thought, it nevertheless stands as a great divide to separate those who think rightly about the faith of Christ from those who think carelessly about it.',' Luke 10:36-37',' \'Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\' The expert in the law replied, \'The one who had mercy on him.\' Jesus told him, \'Go and do likewise.\'',' If you know the truth, live it. Head knowledge is not enough. Living the truth enhances our understanding of it. Even more, living the truth changes us and opens us to receive more truth.',' Forgive me, Lord, for stowing Your truth away in theological cupboards rather than integrating it into my daily living. Your truth liberates!'),(570,'That Incredible Christian','28',' To Be Understood, Truth Must Be Lived','92',' Transforming Truth','The essence of my belief is that there is a difference, a vast difference, between fact and truth. Truth in the Scriptures is more than a fact. A fact may be detached, impersonal, cold and totally disassociated from life. Truth on the other hand, is warm, living and spiritual. A theological fact may be held in the mind for a lifetime without its having any positive effect upon the moral character; but truth is creative, saving, transforming, and it always changes the one who receives it into a humbler and holier man. At what point, then, does a theological fact become for the one who holds it a life-giving truth? At the point where obedience begins. When faith gains the consent of the will to make an irrevocable committal to Christ as Lord, truth begins its saving, illuminating work; and not one moment before.',' John 8:31-32','To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \'If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\'','Truth sets free! Truth embraced, clung to, integrated into everyday living. Truth changes the heart not just the mind.','Father, forgive me for sometimes holding Your truth at arm\'s length — examining it, analyzing it, exegeting it—but failing to fully live it. Your truth sets free.'),(571,'That Incredible Christian','28',' To Be Understood, Truth Must Be Lived','93',' Experientially Knowing Truth',' In His conflict with the religious textualists of His day our Lord often uttered short statements that serve as keys to unlock vast and precious storehouses of truth. In the Gospel according to John these may be found in something amounting to profusion. One such is found in John 7: “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself” (7:17). A. T. Robertson, in his Word Pictures in the New Testament, explains “he shall know” as being “experimental knowledge from willingness to do God’s will.” Then he quotes Westcott: “if there be no sympathy there can be no understanding.” Obviously these words of Christ were understood by the great British biblical scholar Westcott and the brilliant American expositor Robertson as teaching that truth can be understood only by the mind that has surrendered to it. The average evangelical Bible teacher today finds such a radical interpretation too revolutionary to be comfortable and so just ignores it.',' Ephesians 1:17',' I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.',' How is it that the Great God deigns to allow you and me, out of the billions on earth, to know Him in measure and to know His truth? I dont\'t know why but He does.',' I want to know You, Lord, experientially know You, know You better than I know You now. Open my eyes!'),(572,'That Incredible Christian','28',' To Be Understood, Truth Must Be Lived','94',' Surrendering to Truth',' We must be willing to obey if we would know the true inner meaning of the teachings of Christ and the apostles. I believe this view prevailed in every revival that ever came to the Church during her long history. Indeed a revived Church may be distinguished from a dead one by the attitude of its members toward the truth. The dead church holds to the shell of truth without surrendering the will to it, while the church that wills to do God’s will is immediately blessed with a visitation of spiritual powers. Theological facts are like the altar of Elijah on Carmel before the fire came, correct, properly laid out, but altogether cold. When the heart makes the ultimate surrender, the fire falls and true facts are transmuted into spiritual truth that transforms, enlightens, sanctifies. The church or the individual that is Bible taught without being Spirit taught (and there are many of them) has simply failed to see that truth lies deeper than the theological statement of it.',' Psalm 86:11',' Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.',' God does teach us His way. Are we walking in His truth? Unless we do our heart is divided and our faith reduced to intellectual affirmations without full heart commitment.',' Show me, Lord, those areas of Your truth to which I have not yet surrendered. I want to walk in Your truth with an undivided heart.'),(573,'That Incredible Christian','28',' To Be Understood, Truth Must Be Lived','95',' Being Participants in Truth','Truth cannot aid us until we become participators in it. We only possess what we experience. St. Gregory of Sinai, who lived in the fourteenth century, taught that understanding and participation were inseparable in the spiritual life. “He who seeks to understand commandments without fulfilling commandments, and to acquire such understanding through learning and reading, is like a man who takes a shadow for truth. For the understanding of truth is given to those who have become participants in truth (who have tasted it through living). Those who are not participants in truth and are not initiated therein, when they seek this understanding, draw it from a distorted wisdom. Of such men the apostle says ‘the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit,’ even though they boast of their knowledge of truth.” Here is a simple but neglected doctrine that should be restored to its rightful place in the thinking and teaching of the Church. It would work wonders.',' Isaiah 29:13','The Lord says: \'These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship is made up only of rules taught by men.\'','Some of us measure our commitment to Christ by the truth we mouth and the rules we keep—rules which may be man-made and not from God. But truth must be tasted through living if we are to be participants in it.','Lord, teach me what it means to participate in Your truth that through it I may be free.'),(574,'That Incredible Christian','29',' The Sanctification of Our Minds','96',' Thinking is a Kind of Living',' Thinking is a kind of living. To think and to be aware that we think is to be conscious; life without consciousness is but a shadow of life, having no meaning and being of no value to the individual. Our thoughts are the product of our thinking, and since these are of such vast importance to us it is imperative that we learn how to think rightly. I am not concerned here with that kind of profound cerebration known as “heavy thinking.” Few of us have the intellectual equipment to enable us, or the will power to compel us, to engage in such heroic mental exercise. I am dealing here with that kind of thinking done by every normal person every waking moment from birth to death. After all, it is not our heavy thinking that shapes our characters, but the quiet attention of the mind to the surrounding world day after day throughout our lives. Men are influenced more by their common, everyday thinking than by any rare intellectual feat such as writing a great poem or painting a famous picture. Feats of thinking may create reputation, but habits of thinking create character The incredible mental accomplishments of an Einstein, for instance, had almost nothing to do with the kind of human being he was; the constant, undramatic, moment-by-moment interplay of his mind with his environment, on the other hand, had almost everything to do with it. We all live in two environments, the one being the world around us, the other our thoughts about that world. The larger world cannot affect us directly; it must be mediated to us by our thoughts, and will be to us at last only what we allow it to be.',' 2 Peter 3:1',' Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.',' We all think. All day long we think. What we think has so much to do with what we are and what we are becoming. It strongly influences our living. Are we disciplining ourselves in wholesome thinking?',' Holy Spirit, guide me in my thinking. How I perceive and interpret the world around me, the words and actions of people. Stimulate me to wholsome thinking. In Jesus\' name.'),(575,'That Incredible Christian','29',' The Sanctification of Our Minds','97',' Reacting to Circumstances','. . . External things and events are the raw material only; the finished product is whatever the mind makes of these. Judas Iscariot and John the Beloved lived in the same world, but how differently they interpreted it. The same may be said of Cain and Abel, Esau and Jacob, Saul and David. From these we learn that circumstances do not make men; it is their reaction to circumstances that determines what kind of men they will be. What then can we Christians do? The answer is, “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus” (Phpns. 2:5). “Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?” (2 Cor. 13:5). The mental stuff of the Christian can be and should be modified and conditioned by the Spirit of Christ which indwells his nature. God wills that we think His thoughts after Him. The Spirit-filled, prayerful Christian actually possesses the mind of Christ, so that his reactions to the external world are the same as Christ’s. He thinks about people and things just as Christ does. All life becomes to him the raw nectar which the Spirit within him turns into the honey of paradise. Yet this is not automatic. To do His gracious work God must have the intelligent cooperation of His people. If we would think God’s thoughts we must learn to think continually of God. “God thinks continuously of each one of us as if He had no one but ourselves,” said Francois Malaval; “it is therefore no more than just if we think continuously of Him, as if we had no one but Himself.”',' Philippians 2:5','Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.','As Kate Wilkinson put it: \"May the mind of Christ, my Savior, live in me from day to day, by His love and power controlling all I do and say. May the love of Jesus fill me as the waters fill the sea; Him exalting, self abasing—this is victory.\"','Change my thinking, Lord, then shall I be changed.'),(576,'That Incredible Christian','29',' The Sanctification of Our Minds','98',' What Are You Thinking?',' We must think of the surrounding world of people and things against the background of our thoughts of God. The experienced Christian will never think of anything directly; his thoughts go first to God and from God out to His creation. His thoughts, like the angels of Jacob’s ladder, ascend and descend, but ever God stands above them presiding over all. To be heavenly-minded we must think heavenly thoughts. “So let us return to ourselves, brothers, . . . for it is impossible for us to be reconciled and united with God if we do not first return to ourselves . . . striving constantly to keep attention on the kingdom of heaven which is within us.” So wrote Nicephorus, a father of the Greek Orthodox Church, in the fourteenth century, and nothing since has changed. God must have all our thoughts it we would experience the sanctification of our minds.',' Psalm 139:23',' Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.',' What are my thoughts toward God, myself, other people, circumstances and situations? Is my thinking faith-focused or mired in doubt? Do I see other people as God sees them? For many of us, basic changes are needed in our thinking.',' Father, purify my thinking. Increase my sensitivity to what I think. Transform my mind. For Christ\'s sake.'),(577,'That Incredible Christian','30',' The Futility of Regret','99',' That Amazing Grace!',' The human heart is heretical by nature. Popular religious beliefs should be checked carefully against the Word of God, for they are almost certain to be wrong. Legalism, for instance, is natural to the human heart. Grace in its true New Testament meaning is foreign to human reason, not because it is contrary to reason but because it lies beyond it. The doctrine of grace had to be revealed; it could not have been discovered. The essence of legalism is self-atonement. The seeker tries to make himself acceptable to God by some act of restitution, or by self-punishment or the feeling of regret. The desire to be pleasing to God is commendable certainly, but the effort to please God by self-effort is not, for it assumes that sin once done may be undone, an assumption wholly false.',' Psalm 32:1-2',' Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.',' O the blessedness of sins forgiven, knowing that God no longer counts them against us. The amazing grace of God!',' O Christ, I could never atone for my sins. You have done it. I receive the forgiveness You give. I glory in Your grace.'),(578,'That Incredible Christian','30',' The Futility of Regret','100',' The Vain Penance of Perpetual Regret','Long after we have learned from the Scriptures that we cannot, by fasting or the wearing of a hair shirt or the making of many prayers, atone for the sins of the soul, we still tend by a kind of pernicious natural heresy to feel that we can please God and purify our souls by the penance of perpetual regret. This latter is the Protestant’s unacknowledged penance. Though he claims to believe in the doctrine of justification by faith he still secretly feels that what he calls “godly sorrow” will make him dear to God. Though he may know better he is caught in the web of a wrong religious feeling and betrayed.',' Ephesians 2:4-5','But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.','It seems that when we have repeatedly been forgiven for a particular sin and then fall again that asking forgiveness does not seem enough. We feel that we have to do something for God. What we have to do is to ask forgiveness, receive it and then walk by','Thank You for forgiveness and cleansing, Lord. I trust You for enablement to live for You as I walk by Your Spirit day by day.'),(579,'That Incredible Christian','30',' The Futility of Regret','101',' Godly Sorrow that Leaves No Regret',' There is indeed a godly sorrow that worketh repentance (2 Cor. 7:10), and it must be acknowledged that among us Christians this feeling is often not present in sufficient strength to work real repentance; but the persistence of this sorrow till it becomes chronic regret is neither right nor good. Regret is a kind of frustrated repentance that has not been quite consummated. Once the soul has turned from all sin and committed itself wholly to God there is no longer any legitimate place for regret. When moral innocence has been restored by the forgiving love of God the guilt may be remembered, but the sting is gone from the memory. The forgiven man knows that he has sinned, but he no longer feels it. The effort to be forgiven by works is one that can never be completed because no one knows or can know how much is enough to cancel out the offense; so the seeker must go on year after year paying on his moral debt, here a little, there a little, knowing that he sometimes adds to his bill much more than he pays. The task of keeping books on such a transaction can never end, and the seeker can only hope that when the last entry is made he may be ahead and the account fully paid. This is quite the popular belief, this forgiveness by self-effort, but it is a natural heresy and can at last only betray those who depend upon it.',' 2 Corinthians 7:10',' Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.',' Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation. Godly sorrow leaves no regret because genuine repentance has occurred. Perpetual regret is not from God. It only leads to endless effort to earn God\'s grace.',' I know, Lord, that I can never earn Your forgiveness or merit Your grace. Forgive me for trying.'),(580,'That Incredible Christian','30',' The Futility of Regret','102',' Cleansing Destroys Regret',' It may be argued that the absence of regret indicates a low and inadequate view of sin, but the exact opposite is true. Sin is so frightful, so destructive to the soul that no human thought or act can in any degree diminish its lethal effects. Only God can deal with it successfully; only the blood of Christ can cleanse it from the pores of the spirit. The heart that has been delivered from this dread enemy feels not regret but wondrous relief and unceasing gratitude. The returned prodigal honors his father more by rejoicing than by repining. Had the young man in the story had less faith in his father he might have mourned in a corner instead of joining in the festivities. His confidence in the lovingkindness of his father gave him the courage to forget his checkered past.',' Hebrews 9:14',' How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God.',' Christ\'s death for us removes our sin and scrubs clean our consciences. It is time to bury regret and serve the living God!',' Lord, I turn from that regret that refuses to accept Your Word and Your promise. May praise to You fill my heart as I serve You.'),(581,'That Incredible Christian','30',' The Futility of Regret','103',' Penitence or Self-Love?',' Regret frets the soul as tension frets the nerves and anxiety the mind. I believe that the chronic unhappiness of most Christians may be attributed to a gnawing uneasiness lest God has not fully forgiven them, or the fear that He expects as the price of His forgiveness some sort of emotional penance which they have not furnished. As our confidence in the goodness of God mounts, our anxieties will diminish and our moral happiness rise in inverse proportion. Regret may be no more than a form of self-love. A man may have such a high regard for himself that any failure to live up to his own image of himself disappoints him deeply. He feels that he has betrayed his better self by his act of wrongdoing, and even if God is willing to forgive him he will not forgive himself. Sin brings to such a man a painful loss of face that is not soon forgotten. He becomes permanently angry with himself and tries to punish himself by going to God frequently with petulant self-accusations. This state of mind crystallizes finally into a feeling of chronic regret which appears to be a proof of deep penitence but is actually proof of deep self-love. Regret for a sinful past will remain until we truly believe that for us in Christ that sinful past no longer exists. The man in Christ has only Christ’s past and that is perfect and acceptable to God. In Christ he died. In Christ he rose, and in Christ he is seated within the circle of God’s favored ones. He is no longer angry with himself because he is no longer self-regarding, but Christ-regarding; hence there is no place for regret.',' 1 Peter 3:18',' For Christ died for our sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit.',' We don\'t have to tell God how bad we are. He knows. He also knows that He has provided for us new life in Christ. Let\'s live in His grace today, not in our sinful past.',' There is grace with You to cover all my sin. I turn from regret and self-love. Into Your healing stream I plunge.'),(582,'That Incredible Christian','31',' The Importance of Self-Judgment','104',' Self-Discovery',' Hardly anything else reveals so well the fear and uncertainty among men as the length to which they will go to hide their true selves from each other and even from their own eyes. Almost all men live from childhood to death behind a semiopaque curtain, coming out briefly only when forced by some emotional shock and then retreating as quickly as possible into hiding again. The result of this lifelong dissimulation is that people rarely know their neighbors for what they really are, and worse than that, the camouflage is so successful that mostly they do not quite know themselves either. Self-knowledge is so critically important to us in our pursuit of God and His righteousness that we lie under heavy obligation to do immediately whatever is necessary to remove the disguise and permit our real selves to be known. It is one of the supreme tragedies in religion that so many of us think so highly of ourselves when the evidence lies all on the other side; and our self-admiration effectively blocks out any possible effort to discover a remedy for our condition. Only the man who knows he is sick will go to a physician.',' 1 Peter 5:5',' . . . All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because \'God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\'',' Do I know the real me? Our tendency is to refuse to admit what God shows us to be. Yet accurate self-identification is necessary if we are to escape the enemy\'s deception and to grow in Christ.',' Father, deliver me from religious pretense and self-deception. You know the real me. Help me to know also that I may trust You for inner healing.'),(583,'That Incredible Christian','31',' The Importance of Self-Judgment','105',' Discovering Who I Am and Who I Can Be',' Now, our true moral and spiritual state can be disclosed only by the Spirit and the Word. The final judgment of the heart is God’s. There is a sense in which we dare not judge each other (Matt. 7:1-5), and in which we should not even try to judge ourselves ( 1 Cor. 4:3). The ultimate judgment belongs to the One whose eyes are like a flame of fire and who sees quite through the deeds and thoughts of men. I for one am glad to leave the final word with Him. There is, nevertheless, a place for self-judgment and a real need that we exercise it (1 Cor. 11:31-32). While our self-discovery is not likely to be complete and our self-judgment is almost certain to be biased and imperfect, there is yet every good reason for us to work along with the Holy Spirit in His benign effort to locate us spiritually in order that we may make such amendments as the circumstances demand. That God already knows us thoroughly is certain (Psa. 139:1-6). It remains for us to know ourselves as accurately as possible. For this reason I offer some rules for self-discovery; and if the results are not all we could desire they may be at least better than none at all. . . .',' Psalm 139:23-24',' Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.',' In discovering who I am I will also be finding whom I am not and whom I can be through Christ. Revealed will be those areas where I most need to submit to the Spirit\'s transforming power.',' Only by Your power, O Lord, can I be changed into what You desire me to be.'),(584,'That Incredible Christian','31',' The Importance of Self-Judgment','106',' Revelators of Who We Are','. . . We may be known by the following: 1. What we want most. We have but to get quiet, recollect our thoughts, wait for the mild excitement within us to subside, and then listen closely for the faint cry of desire. Ask your heart, What would you rather have than anything else in the world? Reject the conventional answer. Insist on the true one, and when you have heard it you will know the kind of person you are. 2. What we think about most. The necessities of life compel us to think about many things, but the true test is what we think about voluntarily. It is more than likely that our thoughts will cluster about our secret heart treasure, and whatever that is will reveal what we are. “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also” (Matt. 6:21). 3. How we use our money. Again we must ignore those matters about which we are not altogether free. We must pay taxes and provide the necessities of life for ourselves and family, if any. That is routine, merely, and tells us little about ourselves. But whatever money is left to do with as we please—that will tell us a great deal indeed. Better listen to it.',' 1 Peter 3:15a','But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. . . .','Those secret desires, what we think about when free to think what we will, our use of finances—revelators of who we are. Well, who are we?','O God, there is so much of me yet to be changed into what You want me to be.

We may be known by the following: 4. What we do with our leisure time. A large share of our time is already spoken for by the exigencies of civilized living, but we do have some free time. What we do with it is vital. Most people waste it staring at the television, listening to the radio, reading the cheap output of the press or engaging in idle chatter. What I do with mine reveals the kind of man I am. 5. The company we enjoy. There is a law of moral attraction that draws every man to the society most like himself. “Being let go, they went to their own company” (Acts 4:23). Where we go when we are free to go where we will is a near-infallible index of character. 6. Whom and what we admire. I have long suspected that the great majority of evangelical Christians, while kept somewhat in line by the pressure of group opinion, nevertheless have a boundless, if perforce secret, admiration for the world. We can learn the true state of our minds by examining our unexpressed admirations. Israel often admired, even envied, the pagan nations around them, and so forgot the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the law and the promises and the fathers. Instead of blaming Israel let us look to ourselves.',' Colossians 3:17',' And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.',' Our use of leisure, the company we enjoy and our secret objects of admiration disclose much about who we are. Have we subjected those areas to the Spirit\'s review?',' Can I engage in these things in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to You? O God, show me.'),(586,'That Incredible Christian','31','The Importance of Self-Judgment','108','The Misuse of Humor','. . . We may be known by the following: 7. What we laugh at. No one with a due regard for the wisdom of God would argue that there is anything wrong with laughter, since humor is a legitimate component of our complex nature. Lacking a sense of humor we fall that much short of healthy humanity. But the test we are running here is not whether we laugh or not, but what we laugh at. Some things lie outside the field of pure humor. No reverent Christian, for instance, finds death funny, nor birth nor love. No Spirit-filled man can bring himself to laugh at the Holy Scriptures, or the Church which Christ purchased with His own blood, or prayer or righteousness or human grief or pain. And surely no one who has been even for a brief moment in the presence of God could ever laugh at a story involving the Deity. These are a few tests. The wise Christian will find others.','Ephesians 5:4','Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.','God gives us grace to laugh at ourselves and there is much to laugh at. Other targets of humor are subject to restriction because humor can degenerate into mockery of other people and the things of God.','Thank You for the gift of humor, Lord. Make me sensitive to its misuse and misdirection. For Jesus\' sake.'),(587,'That Incredible Christian','32','Serving in the Emergency','109','Fulfilling Our Commission','One mighty fact there is which for us men overwhelms all other considerations and gives significance to everything we do. It is that the human race has left its first estate and is morally and spiritually fallen. Since the fall of man the earth has been a disaster area and everyone lives with a critical emergency. Nothing is normal. Everything is wrong and everyone is wrong until made right by the redeeming work of Christ and the effective operation of the Holy Spirit. The universal disaster of the Fall compels us to think differently about our obligation to our fellow men. What would be entirely permissible under normal conditions becomes wrong in the present situation, and many things not otherwise required are necessary because of abnormal conditions.','John 20:21','Again Jesus said, \"Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.\"','Our Lord Jesus Christ has sent us into the world as the Father sent Him. We do not come as redeemers but as the Lord\'s \"EMS\" Sent Ones, witnessing of Him by life and word.','Lord, so easily I fall into tedium as if all were well in the world. Shock me into seeing the emergency!'),(588,'That Incredible Christian','32','Serving in the Emergency','110','Being God\'s People in this World','. . . The needs of the people, not our own convenience, decide how far we shall go and how much we shall do. Had there been no disaster there would have been no need for the Eternal Son to empty Himself and descend to Bethlehem’s manger. Had there been no Fall there would have been no incarnation, no thorns, no cross. These resulted when the divine goodness confronted the human emergency. While Christ was the perfect example of the healthy normal man, He yet did not live a normal life. He sacrificed many pure enjoyments to give Himself to the holy work of moral rescue. His conduct was determined not by what was legitimate or innocent, but by our human need. He pleased not Himself but lived for the emergency; and as He was so are we in this world. Before the judgment seat of Christ my service will be judged not by how much I have done but by how much I could have done. In God’s sight my giving is measured not by how much I have given but by how much I could have given and how much I had left after I made my gift. The needs of the world and my total ability to minister to those needs decide the worth of my service.','1 Corinthians 12:27','Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.','Some of us are much more alert than others to the major reason for our presence in this world. We are those through whom Christ seeks to reach out to people. He desires to express His love through us to people all around us.','Whom would You reach through me today, Lord? May I be Your instrument through whom You touch others.'),(589,'That Incredible Christian','32','Serving in the Emergency','111','When Our Giving Expresses a Given Heart','Not by its size is my gift judged, but by how much of me there is in it. No man gives at all until he has given all. No man gives anything acceptable to God until he has first given himself in love and sacrifice. The hero is cited by his country not for the number of persons he has saved only, but for the degree of danger to himself present in his act. Service that can be done without peril, that carries no loss, no sacrifice, does not rate high in the sight of men or God. In the work of the Church the amount one man must do to accomplish a given task is determined by how much or how little the rest of the company is willing to do. It is a rare church whose members all put their shoulder to the wheel. The typical church is composed of the few whose shoulders are bruised by their faithful labors and the many who are unwilling to raise a blister in the service of God and their fellow men. There may be a bit of wry humor in all this, but it is quite certain that there will be no laughter when each of us gives account to God of the deeds done in the body.','2 Corinthians 8:3c-5','. . . Entirely on their own, they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints. And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God\'s will.','Those Macedonian believers gave out of severe trial and extreme poverty. They gave joyously and generously, pleading for the privilege of giving to the saints in need. They gave as they did because they first gave themselves to the Lord.','Lord, in giving myself to You did I remember to include my billfold?'),(590,'That Incredible Christian','32','Serving in the Emergency','112','Utilizing Our Spiritual Resources','I think that most Christians would be better pleased if the Lord did not inquire into their personal affairs too closely. They want Him to save them, keep them happy and take them to heaven at last, but not to be too inquisitive about their conduct or service. But He has searched us and knows us; He knows our downsitting and our uprising and understands our thoughts afar off. There is no place to hide from those eyes that are as a flame of fire and there is no way to escape from the judgment of those feet that are like fine brass. It is the part of wisdom to live with these things in mind. God is love and His kindness is unbounded, but He has no sympathy with the carnal mind. He remembers that we are dust, indeed, but He refuses to tolerate the doings of the flesh. He has given us His word; He has promised that we would never be tempted above what we were able to bear; He has placed Himself at our disposal in response to believing prayer; He has made available to us the infinite moral power of His Holy Spirit to enable us to do His will here on earth. There is no excuse for our acting like timid weaklings.','Ephesians 3:20-21','Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in all the church and in Christ Jesus thoughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.','Are we using the spiritual resources God has placed at our disposal? We are enabled believers. But that enablement of the Spirit must be appropriated in daily life.','How I have grieved You, Lord, in failing to utilize the spiritual dynamic You have made available to me. Teach me, Spirit of God!'),(591,'That Incredible Christian','32','Serving in the Emergency','113','Emergency Living','Before there can be acceptable service there must be an acceptable life. Before we can know how much we owe we must learn how great is the need. Men are caught in a disaster worse than earthquake or flood, and the redeemed of the Lord are to work for their rescue. In considering these things we must not go on the defensive. The Lord loves the artless, the candid, the childlike. He cannot work with those who argue or bargain or plead or excuse themselves. He hides His profoundest mysteries from the wise and the prudent and reveals them unto babes. The poor in spirit always receive the kingdom, the meek inherit the earth, the mourner is comforted and the pure in heart see God. My old friend Tom Haire, the praying plumber, after several months of ministry in the United States, told me one day that he was going back home for a rest. In the thickest of Irish brogues he explained how it was with him. “I’m preached out,” he said, “and I am going back to spend three months waiting on God. There are some spiritual matters that I want to get straightened out. I want to appear before the judgment seat now while I can do something about it.”','Matthew 20:28','Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.','A vital ingredient of serving is living. Christlike living will determine how we serve and why. Emergency living gives quality to emergency serving.','Lord, You came to serve, not to be served. May I serve You in serving others.'),(592,'That Incredible Christian','33','How to Keep from Going Stale','114','The Faith Walk','Periods of staleness in the life are not inevitable but they are common. He is a rare Christian who has not experienced times of spiritual dullness when the relish has gone out of his heart and the enjoyment of living has diminished greatly or departed altogether. Since there is no single cause of this condition there is no one simple remedy for it. Sometimes we are to blame, as for instance when we do a wrong act without immediately seeking forgiveness and cleansing; or when we permit worldly interests to grow up and choke the tender plants of the inner life. When the cause is known, and particularly when it is as uncomplex as this, the remedy is the old-fashioned one of repentance. But if after careful and candid examination of the life by prayer and the Word no real evil is discovered, we gain nothing by putting the worst construction on things and lying facedown in the dust. To say that we have not sinned when we have is to be false to the fact; to insist that we have sinned when we have not is to be false to ourselves. There comes a time when the most spiritual thing we can do is to accept cleansing from all sin as an accomplished fact and stop calling that unclean which God has called clean.','2 Corinthians 5:7','We live by faith, not by sight.','There are times when the Christian life is reduced to what it essentially is — a walk by faith. By faith, not by sight or good feelings. God sometimes leads us through a period of dark clouds and we know that He is there only by faith.','Thank You, Lord. I am saved by faith, not by feeling saved. I live, by faith not by feelings. May I clearly distinguish between feelings which can deceive and faith fixed on You.'),(593,'That Incredible Christian','33','How to Keep from Going Stale','115','Taking Time to Rest','Sometimes our trouble is not moral but physical. As long as we are in these mortal bodies our spiritual lives will be to some degree affected by our bodies. Here we should notice that there is a difference between our mortal bodies and the “flesh” of Pauline theology. When Paul speaks of the flesh he refers to our fallen human nature, not to our physical bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Spirit. Through the power of the Spirit there is deliverance from the propensities of the flesh, but while we live there is no relief from the weaknesses and imperfections of the body. One often-unsuspected cause of staleness is fatigue. Shakespeare said something to the effect that no man could be a philosopher when he had a toothache, and while it is possible to be a weary saint, it is scarcely possible to be weary and feel saintly; and it is our want of feeling that we are considering here. The Christian who gets tired in the work of the Lord and stays tired without relief beyond a reasonable time will go stale. The fact that he grew weary by toiling in the Lord’s vineyard will not make his weariness any less real. Our Lord knew this and occasionally took His disciples aside for a rest.','Mark 6:31','Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, \"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\"','Jesus recognized the need of rest for His disciples. He still does! Rest is not an excuse for laziness. It is an essential for effective service.','Father, may I have the good sense to schedule time for rest. Forgive me for sometimes taking on too much and, as a consequence, failing to serve You well.'),(594,'That Incredible Christian','33','How to Keep from Going Stale','116','Resisting Monotony By Means of Variety','Some of the purest souls have written of the dangers of continuous spiritual exercises uninterrupted by lowlier considerations. Von Hugel speaks of the “neutral cost” of prayer and advises that we should sometimes break off thoughts of heavenly things and go for a walk or dig in the garden. We have all known the disappointment felt when returning to a passage of Scripture that had been so fresh and fragrant the day before only to find the sweetness gone out of it. It is the Spirit’s way of urging us on to new vistas. I notice that in the wilderness God kept Israel moving. One may wonder what would have happened if they had camped in one place for forty years. The lives of the great Christians show that they differed not only from each other but from themselves at different periods of their lives. Spiritual exercises that helped them at one stage of their development later became useless and had to be changed for others.','Psalm 40:3a','He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. . . .','Better to pray as we walk than to fall asleep on our knees. Better to struggle in prayer expression than to mouth beautiful phrases that have lost their meaning. Variety in spiritual exercises aids in avoiding a dull and sometimes empty habit.','Thank You, Lord, for the variety and creativity You give to counter monotony and the overly familiar. Help me to stay fresh!'),(595,'That Incredible Christian','33','How to Keep from Going Stale','117','Keeping Fresh','To stay free from religious ennui we should be careful not to get into a rut, not even a good rut. Our Lord warned against vain repetition. There is repetition that is not vain, but oft-repeated prayers become vain when they have lost their urgency. We should examine our prayers every now and again to discover how much sincerity and spontaneity they possess. We should insist on keeping them simple, candid, fresh and original. And above all we should never seek to induce holy emotions. When we feel dry it is wise either to ignore it or to tell God about it without any sense of guilt. If we are dry because of some wrong on our part the Spirit through the Word will show us the fault. In short, we can keep from going stale by getting proper rest, by practicing complete candor in prayer, by introducing variety into our lives, by heeding God’s call to move onward and by exercising quiet faith always.','Psalm 19:14','May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.','Repetition of prayer in the same verbal form may leak meaning and eventually degenerate into empty religious formula. Periodic rephrasing contributes to fresh expression of worship, praise and prayer.','Breath of God, blow upon me. Refresh, renew. In Jesus\' name.'),(596,'That Incredible Christian','34','Marks of the Spiritual Man','118','Concepts of Spirituality','The concept of spirituality varies among different Christian groups. In some circles the highly vocal person who talks religion continually is thought to be very spiritual; others accept noisy exuberance as a mark of spirituality, and in some churches the man who prays first, longest and loudest gets a reputation for being the most spiritual man in the assembly. Now a vigorous testimony, frequent prayers and loud praise may be entirely consistent with spirituality, but it is important that we understand that they do not in themselves constitute it nor prove that it is present. True spirituality manifests itself in certain dominant desires. These are ever-present, deep-settled wants sufficiently powerful to motivate and control the life. . . .','1 Corinthians 3:1-2','Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly — mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it.','It is submission to the control of the Spirit that makes me spiritual. Changes in daily living result as do dominant desires.','Deliver me, Lord, from assuming a form of spirituality that fits people expectations. You know the real me and that is what needs changing.'),(597,'That Incredible Christian','34','Marks of the Spiritual Man','119','Gasping for the Glory of God','True spirituality manifests itself in certain dominant desires. These are ever-present, deep-settled wants sufficiently powerful to motivate and control the life. For convenience let me number them, though I make no effort to decide the order of their importance. 1. First is the desire to be holy rather than happy. The yearning after happiness found so widely among Christians professing a superior degree of sanctity is sufficient proof that such sanctity is not indeed present. The truly spiritual man knows that God will give abundance of joy after we have become able to receive it without injury to our souls, but he does not demand it at once. John Wesley said of the members of one of the earliest Methodist societies that he doubted that they had been made perfect in love because they came to church to enjoy religion instead of to learn how they could become holy. 2. A man may be considered spiritual when he wants to see the honor of God advanced through his life even if it means that he himself must suffer temporary dishonor or loss. Such a man prays “Hallowed be Thy name,” and silently adds, “at any cost to me, Lord.” He lives for God’s honor by a kind of spiritual reflex. Every choice involving the glory of God is for him already made before it presents itself. He does not need to debate the matter with his own heart; there is nothing to debate. The glory of God is necessary to him; he gasps for it as a suffocating man gasps for air.','John 12:27-28','Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? \"Father, save me from this hour\"? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name!','God\'s glory at any cost, even my own. Too often \"our glory\" gets in the way. Self intrudes. It is God\'s glory that matters!','Father, glorify Your name through me. Bring me to that place where I can pray with all my heart \"Your glory at any cost to me.\"'),(598,'That Incredible Christian','34','Marks of the Spiritual Man','120','Cross-Carrying','3. The spiritual man wants to carry his cross. Many Christians accept adversity or tribulation with a sigh and call it their cross, forgetting that such things come alike to saint and sinner. The cross is that extra adversity that comes to us as a result of our obedience to Christ. This cross is not forced upon us; we voluntarily take it up with full knowledge of the consequences. We choose to obey Christ and by so doing choose to carry the cross. Carrying a cross means to be attached to the Person of Christ, committed to the Lordship of Christ and obedient to the commandments of Christ. The man who is so attached, so committed, so obedient is a spiritual man. 4. Again, a Christian is spiritual when he sees everything from God’s viewpoint. The ability to weigh all things in the divine scale and place the same value upon them as God does is the mark of a Spirit-filled life. God looks at and through at the same time. His gaze does not rest on the surface but penetrates to the true meaning of things. The carnal Christian looks at an object or a situation, but because he does not see through it he is elated or cast down by what he sees. The spiritual man is able to look through things as God looks and think of them as God thinks. He insists on seeing all things as God sees them even if it humbles him and exposes his ignorance to the point of real pain.','Matthew 16:24','Then Jesus said to his disciples, \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\"','Today crosses are placed on church steeples or made of gold and used as necklaces or lapel pins. The cross of which Jesus spoke is an instrument of death — ours.','Forgive me, Lord, for storing my cross in the basement. You want me to carry it daily.'),(599,'That Incredible Christian','34','Marks of the Spiritual Man','121','Honoring Others Above Ourselves','5. Another desire of the spiritual man is to die right rather than to live wrong. A sure mark of the mature man of God is his nonchalance about living. The earth-loving, body-conscious Christian looks upon death with numb terror in his heart; but as he goes on to live in the Spirit he becomes increasingly indifferent to the number of his years here below, and at the same time increasingly careful of the kind of life he lives while he is here. He will not purchase a few extra days of life at the cost of compromise or failure. He wants most of all to be right, and he is happy to let God decide how long he shall live. He knows that he can afford to die now that he is in Christ, but he knows that he cannot afford to do wrong, and this knowledge becomes a gyroscope to stabilize his thinking and his acting. 6. The desire to see others advance at his expense is another mark of the spiritual man. He wants to see other Christians above him and is happy when they are promoted and he is overlooked. There is no envy in his heart; when his brethren are honored he is pleased because such is the will of God and that will is his earthly heaven. If God is pleased, he is pleased for that reason, and if it pleases God to exalt another above him he is content to have it so.','Romans 12:10','Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves.','Love for others promotes them above ourselves, even at our expense. It makes us encouragers, developers of people.','Thank You, Father, for those whom You have used to develop me. Use me in honoring and encouraging others. For Jesus\' sake.'),(600,'That Incredible Christian','34','Marks of the Spiritual Man','122','Living With Eternity\'s Values In View','7. The spiritual man habitually makes eternity-judgments instead of time-judgments. By faith he rises above the tug of earth and the flow of time and learns to think and feel as one who has already left the world and gone to join the innumerable company of angels and the general assembly and Church of the First-born which are written in heaven. Such a man would rather be useful than famous and would rather serve than be served. And all this must be by the operation of the Holy Spirit within him. No man can become spiritual by himself. Only the free Spirit can make a man spiritual.','2 Corinthians 4:17','For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.','Living with eternity\'s values in view lightens our momentary troubles. It equips us to live our todays in the perspective of the eternal tomorrow.','Thank You, Father, for the privilege of experiencing inner renewal even when the external wastes away.'),(601,'That Incredible Christian','35','Chastisement and Cross Carrying Not the Same','123','The Rod and the Cross','For the Christian cross carrying and chastisement are alike but not identical. They differ in a number of important ways. The two ideas are usually considered to be the same and the words embodying the ideas are used interchangeably. There is, however, a sharp distinction between them. When we confuse them we are not thinking accurately; and when we do not think accurately about truth we lose some benefit that we might otherwise enjoy. The cross and the rod occur close together in the Holy Scriptures, but they are not the same thing. The rod is imposed without the consent of the one who suffers it. The cross cannot be imposed by another. Even Christ bore the cross by His own free choice. He said of the life He poured out on the cross, “No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself” (John 10:18). He had every opportunity to escape the cross but He set His face like a flint to go to Jerusalem to die. The only compulsion He knew was the compulsion of love.','Luke 14:27','And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.','The rod is an instrument of discipline, correction wielded by the loving Father. The cross is the instrument of self-discipline, dying to self in order to live fully for Christ.','Lord, if I sometimes drop my cross along the way, show me, so that I pick it up again and carry it all the way.'),(602,'That Incredible Christian','35','Chastisement and Cross Carrying are Not the Same','124','Fatherly Chastisement','Chastisement is an act of God; cross carrying an act of the Christian. When God in love lays the rod to the back of His children He does not ask permission. Chastisement for the believer is not voluntary except in the sense that he chooses the will of God with the knowledge that the will of God includes chastisement. “For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?” (Heb. 12:6-7). The cross never comes unsolicited; the rod always does. “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me” (Matt. 16:24). Here is clear, intelligent choice, a choice that must be made by the individual with determination and forethought. In the kingdom of God no one ever stumbled onto a cross. But what is the cross for the Christian? Obviously it is not the wooden instrument the Romans used to execute the sentence of death upon persons guilty of capital crimes. The cross is the suffering the Christian endures as a consequence of his following Christ in perfect obedience. Christ chose the cross by choosing the path that led to it; and it is so with His followers. In the way of obedience stands the cross, and we take the cross when we enter that way.','Hebrews 12:5-6','And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons: \"My son, do not make light of the Lord\'s discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts.\"','Henry Lyte wrote: \"In Thy service pain is pleasure; with Thy favor loss is gain.\" It is that way when we follow Christ carrying our cross. When we drop it, there is discipline in love.','Thank You, Father, that You don\'t abandon me when I fail You. You lovingly discipline me.'),(603,'That Incredible Christian','35','Chastisement and Cross Carrying are Not the Same','125','Chastening is an Expression of God\'s Love','As the cross stands in the way of obedience, so chastisement is found in the way of disobedience. God never chastens a perfectly obedient child. Consider the fathers of our flesh; they never punished us for obedience, only for disobedience. When we feel the sting of the rod we may be sure we are temporarily out of the right way. Conversely, the pain of the cross means that we are in the way. But the Father’s love is not more or less, wherever we may be. God chastens us not that He may love us but because He loves us. In a well-ordered house a disobedient child may expect punishment; in the household of God no careless Christian can hope to escape it.','Hebrews 12:10','Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.','God disciplines us for our good that we may share in His holiness. It is the only way we shall ever share in that holiness. To that end He chastens us in love.','O thank You, Lord, for Your persistent, consistent discipline. I don\'t learn easily and I often have to relearn but You are patiently loving in chastening me.'),(604,'That Incredible Christian','35','Chastisement and Cross Carrying are Not the Same','126','Determining the Cause of Pain','But how can we tell in a given situation whether our pain is from the cross or the rod? Pain is pain from whatever source it comes. Jonah in flight from the will of God suffered no worse storm than did Paul in the center of God’s will; the same wild sea threatened the life of both. And Daniel in the lion’s den was in trouble as deep as was Jonah in the whale’s belly. The nails bit as deep into the hands of Christ dying for the sins of the world as into the hands of the two thieves dying for their own sins. How then may we distinguish the cross from the rod? I think the answer is plain. When tribulation comes we have but to note whether it is imposed or chosen. \"Blessed are ye,\" said our Lord, “when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you” (Matt. 5:11). But that is not all. Four other words He added: they are “falsely, for my sake.” These words show that the suffering must come voluntarily, that it must be chosen in the larger choice of Christ and righteousness. If the accusation men cry against us is true, no blessedness follows.','Hebrews 12:11','No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.','C. S. Lewis wrote of God shouting to us in our pains, using pain as a megaphone to rouse a deaf world. Pain is a loud summons to self-examination. Are we suffering for the cause of Christ or because of personal sin?','Father, when I am experiencing pain due to my sin, help me to recognize it. When it is for other reasons may I accept it as fromYou.'),(605,'That Incredible Christian','35','Chastisement and Cross Carrying are Not the Same','127','That Questionable Suffering','We delude ourselves when we try to turn our just punishments into a cross and rejoice over that for which we should rather repent. “For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God” (1 Pet. 2:20) . The cross is always in the way of righteousness. We feel the pain of the cross only when we suffer for Christ’s sake by our own willing choice. I think that there is also another kind of suffering, one that does not fall into either of the categories considered above. It comes neither from the rod nor from the cross, not being imposed as a moral corrective nor suffered as a result of our Christian life and testimony. It comes in the course of nature and arises from the many ills flesh is heir to. It visits all alike in a greater or lesser degree and would appear to have no clear spiritual significance. Its source may be fire, flood, bereavement, injuries, accidents, illness, old age, weariness or the upset conditions of the world generally. What are we to do about this? Well, some great souls have managed to turn even these neutral afflictions to good. By prayer and self-abasement they wooed adversity to become their friend and made rough distress a teacher to instruct them in the heavenly arts. May we not emulate them?','Job 23:10','But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.','Pain pushes us into the arms of God. There are times when we cannot discern whether it is our cross or chastisement. We can only cling to Him and we find in our hurting His arms tightly around us.','You know the way I take, Father, the purpose in my hurting. Show me or, if not, hold me close in Your arms.'),(606,'That Incredible Christian','36','The Wind in Our Face','128','With the Wind in Your Face','Are You Feeling the Wind?  “God hath called you to Christ’s side,” wrote the saintly Rutherford, “and the wind is now in Christ’s face in this land; and seeing ye are with Him, ye cannot expect the leeside or the sunny side of the brae.” With that beautiful feeling for words that characterized Samuel Rutherford’s most casual utterance he here crystallizes for us one of the great radical facts of the Christian life. The wind is in Christ’s face, and because we go with Him we too shall have the wind in our face. We should not expect less. The yearning for the sunny side of the brae is natural enough, and for such sensitive creatures as we are it is, I suppose, quite excusable. No one enjoys walking into a cold wind. Yet the Church has had to march with the wind in her face through the long centuries.','Micah 6:8','He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.','Our desire is to be accepted, to blend in. Yet to walk with Christ means to stay at His side and inevitably that will mean facing the cold and bitter wind. Are you feeling the wind?','Lord, I want to walk with You even into the wind!'),(607,'That Incredible Christian','36','The Wind in Our Face','129','Costly Discipleship','In our eagerness to make converts I am afraid we have lately been guilty of using the technique of modern salesmanship, which is of course to present only the desirable qualities in a product and ignore the rest. We go to men and offer them a cozy home on the sunny side of the brae. If they will but accept Christ He will give them peace of mind, solve their problems, prosper their business, protect their families and keep them happy all day long. They believe us and come, and the first cold wind sends them shivering to some counselor to find out what has gone wrong; and that is the last we hear of many of them. The teachings of Christ reveal Him to be a realist in the finest meaning of that word. Nowhere in the Gospels do we find anything visionary or overoptimistic. He told His hearers the whole truth and let them make up their minds. He might grieve over the retreating form of an inquirer who could not face up to the truth, but He never ran after him to try to win him with rosy promises. He would have men follow Him, knowing the cost, or He would let them go their ways. All this is but to say that Christ is honest. We can trust Him. He knows that He will never be popular among the sons of Adam and He knows that His followers need not expect to be. The wind that blows in His face will be felt by all who travel with Him, and we are not intellectually honest when we try to hide that fact from them.','John 6:66','From this time on many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.','Following Christ is costly in many ways. For some it means physical suffering, even death. For others rejection, ostracism, extreme prejudice. The greatest cost of all is to the old nature, ego, self. Yet consider the cost of not following Christ.','Lord, if I turn from following You, to whom do I go? Eternal life is in knowing You.'),(608,'That Incredible Christian','36','The Wind in Our Face','130','Worth Suffering For','What has Christ to offer to us that is sound, genuine and desirable? He offers forgiveness of sins, inward cleansing, peace with God, eternal life, the gift of the Holy Spirit, victory over temptation, resurrection from the dead, a glorified body, immortality and a dwelling place in the house of the Lord forever. These are a few benefits that come to us as a result of faith in Christ and total committal to Him. Add to these the expanding wonders and increasing glories that shall be ours through the long, long reaches of eternity, and we get an imperfect idea of what Paul called, \"the unsearchable riches of Christ.” To accept the call of Christ changes the returning sinner indeed, but it does not change the world. The wind still blows toward hell and the man who is walking in the opposite direction will have the wind in his face. And we had better take this into account when we ponder on spiritual things. If the unsearchable riches of Christ are not worth suffering for, then we should know it now and cease to play at religion.','Philippians 3:8','What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ . . .','If we are not now in some measure experiencing the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ, then indeed we may be tightly clinging to some things fearing their loss.','Father, help me to clearly distinguish between what is eternal gain and what is ultimate rubbish.'),(609,'That Incredible Christian','36','The Wind in Our Face','131','Inescapable Choices','When the rich young ruler learned the cost of discipleship he went away sorrowing. He could not give up the sunny side of the brae. But thanks be to God, there are some in every age who refuse to go back. The Acts of the Apostles is the story of men and women who turned their faces into the stiff wind of persecution and loss and followed the Lamb whithersoever He went. They knew that the world hated Christ without a cause and hated them for His sake; but for the glory that was set before them they continued steadfastly on the way. Perhaps the whole thing can be reduced to a simple matter of faith or unbelief. Faith sees afar the triumph of Christ and is willing to endure any hardship to share in it. Unbelief is not sure of anything except that it hates the wind and loves the sunny side of the brae. Every man will have to decide for himself whether or not he can afford the terrible luxury of unbelief.','Matthew 19:22','When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.','The rich young ruler sounds like one of the new millionaires of Silicon Valley. Most of us won\'t have the option of millions. We just choose the relative wealth of this world, living for the few years of our lifetime.

Had not God said first “Ye are my friends” (John 15:14) it would be inexcusably brash for any man to say “I am a friend of God.” But since He claims us for His friends it is an act of unbelief to ignore or deny the relationship. . . . Even though radically different from each other, two persons may enjoy the closest friendship for a lifetime; for it is not a requisite of friendship that the participants be alike in all things; it is enough that they be alike at the points where their personalities touch. Harmony is likeness at points of contact, and friendship is likeness where hearts merge. For this reason the whole idea of the divine-human friendship is logical enough and entirely credible. The infinite God and the finite man can merge their personalities in the tenderest, most satisfying friendship. In such relationship there is no idea of equality; only of likeness where the heart of man meets the heart of God. This likeness is possible because God at the first made man in His own image and because He is now remaking men in the image that was lost by sin.','John 15:24','You are my friends if you do what I command.','That we are created in God\'s image is mind-blowing. Granted, sin has marred and distorted that image but it has not been destroyed. What immense possibilities are open to us through image restoration — not least of which is friendship with God.','Lord, show me something of what it can mean to be in friendship with You!');

God is uncreated, self-existent, infinite, sovereign, eternal; these attributes are His alone and by their very definition cannot be shared with another. But there are other attributes which He can impart to His creatures and in some measure share with His redeemed children. Intellect, self-consciousness, love, goodness, holiness, pity, faithfulness — these and certain other attributes are the points where likeness between God and man may be achieved. It is here that the divine-human friendship is experienced.','James 2:23','And the scripture was fulfilled that says, \"Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness,\" and he was called God\'s friend.','Abraham, despite weakness and failure, was called God\'s friend. Abraham believed God. He just believed God. Are we friends of God?','Lord, help us to discern and revere your attributes, while willfully exercising those which You have imparted to us for Your glory and our sanctification. Expand our faith beyond human limitations and weaknesses, that we may experience true intimacy with You.'),(612,'That Incredible Christian','37','The Friends of God','134','Growing in Experiential Union','God, being perfect, has capacity for perfect friendship. Man, being imperfect, can never quite know perfection in anything, least of all in his relation to the incomprehensible Godhead. Perfection lies on God’s side, but on man’s side there are weakness of purpose, lack of desire, small faith and numerous other impediments. These make for a friendship which, though it is the most wonder-filled experience possible to man, is yet short of that completeness we would enjoy if these impediments were removed or even reduced appreciably. Though the truth compels us to admit these imperfections on our side of the divine-human friendship, yet there is no reason to despair. In spite of our human frailties we can grow in grace and move progressively toward a more perfect experiential union with God. This we can do by firm self-discipline, quick obedience, unceasing prayer, utter detachment from the world and the exercise of robust faith in the truths revealed in the Holy Scriptures.','John 15:15','I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master\'s business. Instead I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.','Seeing Jesus with His disciples reveals something of the experiential union we can know with God. Christ the God-Man in His deity shows us what God is like and in His humanity what we can become. He calls us to deepening friendship.','Lord, what You have learned from the Father You are making known to me. You call me \"friend,\" too!'),(613,'That Incredible Christian','37','The Friends of God','135','Friendship Trust','It should be pointed out that no revealed truth becomes automatically effective. The effect any truth has upon us depends upon our attitude toward it. First it must be accepted in active faith and received into our minds as completely trustworthy and beyond dispute. It must become a kind of dye to give color to all of our thinking and praying. The more perfect our friendship with God becomes the simpler will our lives be. Those formalities that are so necessary to keep a casual friendship alive may be dispensed with when true friends sit in each other’s presence. True friends trust each other.','John 14:1','Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.','True friendship is based on mutual trust. If we can trust Christ for salvation, why can\'t we trust God in all areas of life? There is no alternative.','Lord, how often my heart is troubled because I don\'t trust You. I am letting go and trustfully sinking into Your arms.'),(614,'That Incredible Christian','37','The Friends of God','136','Friends or Just Acquaintances?','There is a great difference between having “company” and having a friend in the house. The friend we can treat as a member of the family, but company must be entertained. God is not satisfied until there exists between Him and His people a relaxed informality that requires no artificial stimulation. The true friend of God may sit in His presence for long periods in silence. Complete trust needs no words of assurance. Such words have long ago been spoken and the adoring heart can safely be still before God. Unquestionably the highest privilege granted to man on earth is to be admitted into the circle of the friends of God. Nothing is important enough to be allowed to stand in the way of our relation to God. Nothing in heaven or earth or hell can separate us from the love of God; we should see to it that nothing on earth shall separate us from God’s friendship.','Proverbs 18:23','A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother.','Have we entered the circle of God\'s friends? Some of us remain acquaintances. We have not yet become friends. His invitation to warm friendship is extended to us.','Lord, it staggers the mind that I can enter into friendship with You, the eternal God.'),(615,'That Incredible Christian','38','The Ministry of the Night','137','Dross Removal','If God sets out to make you an unusual Christian He is not likely to be as gentle as He is usually pictured by the popular teachers. A sculptor does not use a manicure set to reduce the rude, unshapely marble to a thing of beauty. The saw, the hammer and the chisel are cruel tools, but without them the rough stone must remain forever formless and unbeautiful. To do His supreme work of grace within you He will take from your heart everything you love most. Everything you trust in will go from you. Piles of ashes will lie where your most precious treasures used to be. This is not to teach the sanctifying power of poverty. If to be poor made men holy every tramp on park bench would be a saint. But God knows the secret of removing things from our hearts while they still remain to us. What He does is to restrain us from enjoying them. He lets us have them but makes us psychologically unable to let our hearts go out to them. Thus they are useful without being harmful.','Hebrews 12:29','For our God is a consuming fire.','The old hymn put it well: \"When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, my grace all sufficient shall be thy supply. The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.\"','Remove the dross, O Lord, even though I whimper and moan. Purify me.

Everything you trust in will go from you. Piles of ashes will lie where your most precious treasures used to be. . . . All this God will accomplish at the expense of the common pleasures that have up to that time supported your life and made it zestful. Now under the careful treatment of the Holy Spirit your life may become dry, tasteless and to some degree a burden to you. While in this state you will exist by a kind of blind will to live; you will find none of the inward sweetness you had enjoyed before. The smile of God will be for the time withdrawn, or at least hidden from your eyes. Then you will learn what faith is; you will find out the hard way, but the only way open to you, that true faith lies in the will, that the joy unspeakable of which the apostle speaks is not itself faith but a slow-ripening fruit of faith; and you will learn that present spiritual joys may come and go as they will without altering your spiritual status or in any way affecting your position as a true child of the Heavenly Father. And you will also learn, probably to your astonishment, that it is possible to live in all good conscience before God and men and still feel nothing of the “peace and joy” you hear talked about so much by immature Christians.','Psalm 42:11','Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.','When the sense of His presense is withdrawn and your life seems to shatter; when you feel cold and dull spiritually, keep praying. Keep feeding on His Word. Keep walking by faith — naked faith. He is there. Trust Him.','Lord, I find it difficult to walk by faith in the night. But You are teaching me.

The words “The day is thine, the night also is thine” will now be interpreted for you by the best of all teachers, the Holy Spirit; and you will know by personal experience what a blessed thing is the ministry of the night. But there is a limit to man’s ability to live without joy. Even Christ could endure the cross only because of the joy set before Him. The strongest steel breaks if kept too long under unrelieved tension. God knows exactly how much pressure each one of us can take. He knows how long we can endure the night, so He gives the soul relief, first by welcome glimpses of the morning star and then by the fuller light that harbingers the morning.','Psalm 13:1,5a','How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? . . . But I trust in your unfailing love . . .','There are times when we pray by faith with no sense of His presence; witness and there is no response; serve without joy or recognition.

You will feel and understand the ministry of the night; its power to purify, to detach, to humble, to destroy the fear of death and, what is more important to you at the moment, the fear of life. And you will learn that sometimes pain can do what even joy cannot, such as exposing the vanity of earth’s trifles and filling your heart with longing for the peace of heaven. What I write here is in no way original. This has been discovered anew by each generation of Christian seekers and is almost a cliché of the deeper life. Yet it needs to be said to this generation of believers often and with emphasis, for the type of Christianity now in vogue does not include anything as serious and as difficult as this. The quest of the modern Christian is likely to be for peace of mind and spiritual joy, with a good degree of material prosperity thrown in as an external proof of the divine favor. Some will understand this, however, even if the number is relatively small, and they will constitute the hard core of practicing saints so badly needed at this serious hour if New Testament Christianity is to survive to the next generation.','Job 23:8-10','But if I go to the east, he is not here; if I go to the west, I do not find him. When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him. But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come out as gold.','Wrote Marcus Rainsford: \"It is not when we are enjoying Christ most that we glorify him best; It is when . . . our hearts are consciously cold and dead, when our feelings are all distressing . . . when we walk in darkness and have no light . . . then to','You know the way I take and why.

They have said, for instance, that man is the thinking animal, or that he is the laughing animal, or that he is the only animal with a conscience. The one mark, however, which forever distinguishes man from all other forms of life on earth is that he is a worshiper; he has a bent toward and a capacity for worship. Apart from his position as a worshiper of God, man has no sure key to his own being; he is but a higher animal, being born much as any other animal, going through the cycle of his life here on earth and dying at last without knowing what the whole thing is about. If that is all for him, if he has no more reason than the beast for living, then it is an odd thing indeed that he is the only one of the animals that worries about himself, that wonders, that asks questions of the universe. The very fact that he does these things tells the wise man that somewhere there is One to whom he owes allegiance, One before whom he should kneel and do homage. The Christian revelation tells us that that One is God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, who is to be worshiped in the Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord. That is enough for us. Without trying to reason it out we may proceed from there. All our doubts we meet with faith’s wondering affirmation: “O Lord God, thou knowest,” an utterance which Samuel Taylor Coleridge declared to be the profoundest in human speech.','Isaiah 43:6b-7','. . . Bring back my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth — everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.','Unique among creation, we are made to worship God to His glory.

You have created me for Your glory.'),(620,'That Incredible Christian','39',' The Art of True Worship','142','Worshiping God with All We Are','In worship several elements may be distinguished, among them love, admiration, wonder and adoration. Though they may not be experienced in that order, a little thought will reveal those elements as being present wherever true worship is found. Both the Old and the New Testament teach that the essence of true worship is the love of God. “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.” Our Lord declared this to be the sum of the Law and the Prophets. Now, love is both a principle and an emotion; it is something both felt and willed. It is capable of almost infinite degrees. Love in the human heart may begin so modestly as to be hardly perceptible and go on to become a raging torrent that sweeps its possessor before it in total helplessness. Something like this must have been the experience of the apostle Paul, for he felt it necessary to explain to his critics that his apparent madness was actually the love of God ravishing his willing heart. It is quite impossible to worship God without loving Him. Scripture and reason agree to declare this. And God is never satisfied with anything less than all: “all thy heart . . . all thy soul . . . all thy might.” This may not at first be possible, but deeper experience with God will prepare us for it, and the inward operations of the Holy Spirit will enable us after a while to offer Him such a poured-out fullness of love.','Mark 12:30-31','\"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.\" The second is this: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" There is no commandment greater than these.','God has designed us to be loving worshipers — to love Him with all our heart, soul, mind and strength. Only by His Spirit within can we grow to love Him and people with all we are.','O God, fill me with Your love. My love is so superficial. Teach me to love with all I am.'),(621,'That Incredible Christian','39',' The Art of True Worship','143','Worshiping the Giver','In the love which any intelligent creature feels for God there must always be a measure of mystery. It is even possible that it is almost wholly mystery, and that our attempt to find reasons is merely a rationalizing of a love already mysteriously present in the heart as a result of some secret operation of the Spirit within us, \"working like a miner, toiling unseen in the depths of the earth” (Fenelon). But so far as reasons can be given, they would seem to be two: gratitude and excellence. To love God because He has been good to us is one of the most reasonable things possible. The love which arises from the consideration of His kindness to us is valid and altogether acceptable to Him. It is nevertheless a lower degree of love, being less selfless than that love which springs from an appreciation of what God is in Himself apart from His gifts. Thus the simple love which arises from gratitude, when expressed in any act or conscious utterance, is undoubtedly worship. But the quality of our worship is stepped up as we move away from the thought of what God has done for us and nearer the thought of the excellence of His holy nature. This leads us to admiration.','Psalm 95:6','Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker','What do we know of worship — worship true and pure? We give God thanks for what He does and what He gives but seldom for who He is.','Thank You, Lord, for the gifts I receive from You. But I want to worship You, the Giver. Apart from any gifts You give, You are worthy to be worshiped.'),(622,'That Incredible Christian','39',' The Art of True Worship','144','Admiring God','The dictionary says that to admire is “to regard with wondering esteem accompanied by pleasure and delight; to look at or upon with an elevated feeling of pleasure.” According to this definition, God has few admirers among Christians today. Many are they who are grateful for His goodness in providing salvation. At Thanksgiving time the churches ring with songs of gratitude that “all is safely gathered in.” Testimony meetings are mostly devoted to recitations of incidents where someone got into trouble and got out again in answer to prayer. To decry this would be uncharitable and unscriptural for there is much of the same thing in the Book of Psalms. It is good and right to render unto God thanksgiving for all His mercies to us. But God’s admirers, where are they? The simple truth is that worship is elementary until it begins to take on the quality of admiration. Just as long as the worshiper is engrossed with himself and his good fortune, he is a babe. We begin to grow up when our worship passes from thanksgiving to admiration. As our hearts rise to God in lofty esteem for that which He is (“I AM THAT I AM”), we begin to share a little of the selfless pleasure which is the portion of the blessed in heaven.','Psalm 145:3','Great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom.','Great is Yahweh! His greatness is humanly unfathomable. His greatness is in who He is. So little time do we devote to just reflecting upon His greatness. It is that reflection that generates heart worship.','O God, You are great, great beyond my ability to grasp, but I worship You, O Lord!'),(623,'That Incredible Christian','39',' The Art of True Worship','145','Wondering Worship','The third stage of true worship is wonder. Here the mind ceases to understand and goes over to a kind of delightful astonishment. Carlyle said that worship is “transcendent wonder,” a degree of wonder without limit and beyond expression. That kind of worship is found throughout the Bible (though it is only fair to say that the lesser degrees of worship are found there also). Abraham fell on his face in holy wonderment as God spoke to him. Moses hid his face before the presence of God in the burning bush. Paul could hardly tell whether he was in or out of the body when he was allowed to see the unspeakable glories of the third heaven. When John saw Jesus walking among His churches, he fell at His feet as dead. We cite these as examples; the list is long in the Biblical record. It may be said that such experiences as these are highly unusual and can be no criterion for the plain Christian today. This is true, but only of the external circumstances; the spiritual content of the experiences is unchanging and is found alike wherever true believers are found. It is always true that an encounter with God brings wonderment and awe. The pages of Christian biography are sweet with the testimonies of enraptured worshipers who met God in intimate experience and could find no words to express all they felt and saw and heard. Christian hymnody takes us where the efforts of common prose break down, and brings the wings of poetic feeling to the aid of the wondering saint. Open an old hymnal and turn to the sections on worship and the divine perfections and you will see the part that wonder has played in worship through the centuries. But wonder is not yet the last nor highest element in worship. The soaring saint has one more mountain peak to clear before he has reached the rarefied air of purest worship. He must adore.','Daniel 9:4','. . . O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with all who love him and obey his commands.','Frederick Faber was one of those enraptured worshipers. He prayed: \"Father of Jesus, love\'s reward. What rapture will it be prostrate before Thy throne to lie, and gaze and gaze on Thee!\" When is the last time you so gazed?','O Lord, what delight to pause from asking and just to gaze, to gaze upon You.'),(624,'That Incredible Christian','39',' The Art of True Worship','146',' Adoring Worship',' Neither the word adoration nor any of its forms is found in our familiar King James Bible, but the idea is there in full bloom. The great Bible saints were, above all, enraptured lovers of God. The psalms celebrate the love which David (and a few others) felt for the person of God. As suggested above, Paul admitted that the love of God was in his breast a kind of madness: “For whether we be beside ourselves, it is of God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. For the love of Christ constraineth us” (2 Cor. 5:13-14). In Weymouth’s translation the passage reads, “For the love of Christ overmasters us.” The idea appears to be that Paul’s love for Christ carried him beyond himself and made him do extravagant things which to a mind untouched with the delights of such love might seem quite irrational. Perhaps the most serious charge that can be brought against modern Christians is that we are not sufficiently in love with Christ. The Christ of Fundamentalism is strong but hardly beautiful. It is rarely that we find anyone aglow with personal love for Christ. I trust it is not uncharitable to say that in my opinion a great deal of praise in conservative circles is perfunctory and forced, where it is not downright insincere.',' 2 Corinthians 5:13-14',' If we are out of our mind, it is for you. For Christ\'s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.',' Adoring worship is an expression of compelling love.',' O Father, may I grow as an adorer of You!'),(625,'That Incredible Christian','39',' The Art of True Worship','147','Reverent Worship','Many of our popular songs and choruses in praise of Christ are hollow and unconvincing. Some are even shocking in their amorous endearments, and strike a reverent soul as being a kind of flattery offered to One with whom neither composer nor singer is acquainted. The whole thing is in the mood of the love ditty, the only difference being the substitution of the name of Christ for that of the earthly lover. How different and how utterly wonderful are the emotions aroused by a true and Spirit-incited love for Christ. Such a love may rise to a degree of adoration almost beyond the power of the heart to endure, yet at the same time it will be serious, elevated, chaste and reverent. Christ can never be known without a sense of awe and fear accompanying the knowledge. He is the fairest among ten thousand, but He is also the Lord high and mighty. He is meek and lowly in heart, but He is also Lord and Christ who will surely come to be the judge of all men. No one who knows Him intimately can ever be flippant in His presence.','Matthew 28:9','Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.','Our \"worship services\" are sometimes more flippant than contemplative, more entertaining than nourishing. Historically the Church has gone through periods when there seemed to be little joy in worship. The problem in evangelical culture today may be the','O Risen Christ, in heart I would fall at Your feet and worship You!'),(626,'That Incredible Christian','39',' The Art of True Worship','148','Loving Worship','The love of Christ both wounds and heals, it fascinates and frightens, it kills and makes alive, it draws and repulses, it sobers and enraptures. There can be nothing more terrible or more wonderful than to be stricken with love for Christ so deeply that the whole being goes out in a pained adoration of His person, an adoration that disturbs and disconcerts while it purges and satisfies and relaxes the deep inner heart. This love as a kind of moral fragrance is ever detected upon the garments of the saints. In the writings of Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, for instance, this fragrance is so strong as to be very nearly intoxicating. There are passages in his Confessions so passionately sweet as to be unbearable, yet so respectful and self-effacing as to excite pity for the man who thus kneels in adoring wonder, caught between holy love and an equally holy fear. The list of fragrant saints is long. It includes men and women of every shade of theological thought within the bounds of the orthodox Christian faith. It embraces persons of every social level, every degree of education, every race and color. This radiant love for Christ is to my mind the true test of catholicity, the one sure proof of membership in the Church universal.','Revelation 5:13-14','Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: \"To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!\" The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.','Prayed Augustine: \"You are the life of lives, the life of souls. You are livingness itself, and You will not change, O Light of my soul\" (F. J. Sheed translation). The prayer of an adorer!','O God, I\'m but a beginner in the worship of You. Teach me, Lord, in Jesus\' name.'),(627,'That Incredible Christian','39',' The Art of True Worship','149','Wanted: Worshipers','It remains only to be said that worship as we have described it here is almost (though, thank God, not quite) a forgotten art in our day. For whatever we can say of modern Bible-believing Christians, it can hardly be denied that we are not remarkable for our spirit of worship. The gospel as preached by good men in our times may save souls, but it does not create worshipers. Our meetings are characterized by cordiality, humor, affability, zeal and high animal spirits; but hardly anywhere do we find gatherings marked by the overshadowing presence of God. We manage to get along on correct doctrine, fast tunes, pleasing personalities and religious amusements. How few, how pitifully few are the enraptured souls who languish for love of Christ. The sweet “madness” that visited such men as Bernard and St. Francis and Richard Rolle and Jonathan Edwards and Samuel Rutherford is scarcely known today. The passionate adorations of Teresa and Madame Guyon are a thing of the past. Christianity has fallen into the hands of leaders who knew not Joseph. The very memory of better days is slowly passing from us and a new type of religious person is emerging. How is the gold tarnished and the silver become lead! If Bible Christianity is to survive the present world upheaval, we shall need to recapture the spirit of worship. We shall need to have a fresh revelation of the greatness of God and the beauty of Jesus. We shall need to put away our phobias and our prejudices against the deeper life and seek again to be filled with the Holy Spirit. He alone can raise our cold hearts to rapture and restore again the art of true worship.','Isaiah 6:5','\"Woe to me!\" I cried, \"I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty.\"','Have we learned to worship? We have worship leaders, worship teams, worship choruses. We have folksy sermons and pleasant humor. Is there worship? Are we ever struck speechless by the awesome presence of God?','Lord, make me a worshiper of You.'),(628,'That Incredible Christian','40',' Love\'s Final Test','150','\"Do You Love Me?\"','A century ago a hymn was often sung in the churches, the first stanza of which ran like this: ‘Tis a point I long to know, Oft it causes anxious thought, Do I love the Lord, or no! Am I His, or am I not? Those who thus confessed their spiritual anxiety were serious-minded, honest men and women who could open their hearts to each other in this manner without self-consciousness or loss of face. It is an evidence of the essential frivolity of the modern religious mind that this hymn is never sung today, and if mentioned from the pulpit at all it is quoted humorously as proof that those who once sang it were not up on the doctrine of grace. Why ask, “Do I love the Lord, or no?” when any number of personal workers stand by to quote convenient texts from the New Testament to prove that we do? But we had better not be too cocksure. The gravest question any of us face is whether we do or do not love the Lord. Too much hinges on the answer to pass the matter off lightly. And it is a question that no one can answer for another. Not even the Bible can tell the individual man that he loves the Lord; it can only tell him how he can know whether or not he does. It can and does tell us how to test our hearts for love as a man might test ore for the presence of uranium, but we must do the testing.',' John 21:15','When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?\" \"Yes, Lord,\" he said, \"You know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Feed my lambs.\"','Vehemently Peter had declared that though all others fall away he would never disown his Lord even if it meant his death (Mark 14:27-31). In the intervening hours the test came and Peter failed. He recognizes the weakness of his love and the Lord begins','Easy enough, Lord, to sing hymns and choruses declaring my love for You. But do I love You with agape love? Perfect my love.'),(629,'That Incredible Christian','40',' Love\'s Final Test','151','Love Expressed in Obedience','Our Lord told His disciples that love and obedience were organically united, that the keeping of His sayings would prove that we loved Him and the failure or refusal to keep them would prove that we did not. This is the true test of love, and we will be wise to face up to it. The commandments of Christ occupy in the New Testament a place of importance that they do not have in current evangelical thought. The idea that our relation to Christ is revealed by our attitude to His commandments is now considered legalistic by many influential Bible teachers, and the plain words of our Lord are rejected outright or interpreted in a manner to make them conform to theories ostensibly based upon the epistles of Paul. Thus the Word of God is denied as boldly by evangelicals as by admitted modernists.','John 14:21','Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him.','The disciples awaited the coming of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost. What a difference His indwelling would make in their love and their obedience. The book of Acts records some of that difference.','O Lord, I want to lovingly obey You. You are my life. May I be sensitive today to Your Spirit\'s direction.'),(630,'That Incredible Christian','40',' Love\'s Final Test','152',' Crises of Love',' If we lived in a spiritual Utopia where every wind blew toward heaven and every man was a friend of God, we Christians could take everything for granted, counting on the new life within us to cause us to do the will of God without effort and more or less unconsciously. Unfortunately we have opposing us the lusts of the flesh, the attractions of the world and the temptations of the devil. These complicate our lives and require us often to make determined moral decisions on the side of Christ and His commandments. It is the crisis that forces us to take a stand for or against. The patriot may be loyal to his country for half a lifetime without giving much thought to it, but let an unfriendly power solicit him to turn traitor and he will quickly spurn its overtures. His patriotism will be brought out into the open for everyone to see. So it is in the Christian life. When the “south wind blew softly” (Acts 27:13) the ship that carried Paul sailed smoothly enough and no one on board knew who Paul was or how much strength of character lay hidden behind that rather plain exterior. But when the mighty tempest, Euroclydon, burst upon them Paul’s greatness was soon the talk of everyone on the ship. The apostle, though himself a prisoner quite literally took command of the vessel, made decisions and issued orders that meant life or death to the people. And I think the crisis brought to a head something in Paul that had not previously been clear even to him. Beautiful theory was quickly crystallized into hard fact when the tempest struck.',' Romans 5:5',' And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.',' Since God\'s love is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, we can love with God\'s love in those love crises we experience. There is an enabling power to love far beyond our feeble human resources. Let\'s use it!',' Grip me, Lord, with Your love. Squeeze Your love through me to You and those around me. For Jesus\' sake.'),(631,'That Incredible Christian','40',' Love\'s Final Test','153','Tests of Love','The Christian cannot be certain of the reality and depth of his love until he comes face-to-face with the commandments of Christ and is forced to decide what to do about them. Then he will know. “He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings” (John 14:24), said our Lord. “He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me\" (John 14:21). So the final test of love is obedience. Not sweet emotions, not willingness to sacrifice, not zeal, but obedience to the commandments of Christ. Our Lord drew a line plain and tight for everyone to see. On one side He placed those who keep His commandments and said, “These love Me.” On the other side He put those who keep not His sayings, and said, “These love Me not.”','1 John 5:3','This is love for God: to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome.','The commands of the one who so loved us are not burdensome. If we have experienced His love we can be sure that obedience to His word shows love and also results in our growth as His people.','O Christ, You gave Yourself for me. What love! I belong to You. May I show my love in obeying You.'),(632,'That Incredible Christian','40',' Love\'s Final Test','154',' Living Love',' Love for Christ is a love of willing as well as a love of feeling, and it is psychologically impossible to love Him adequately unless we will to obey His words. In seeking to learn whether we truly love our Lord we must be careful to apply His own test. False tests can only lead to false conclusions as false signs on the highway lead to wrong destinations. The Lord made it plain enough, but with our genius for getting mixed up we have lost sight of the markers. I think if we would turn for a while from finespun theological speculations about grace and faith and humbly read the New Testament with a mind to obey what we see there, we would easily find ourselves and know for certain the answer to the question that troubled our fathers and should trouble us: Do we love the Lord or no?',' John 14:15',' If you love me, you will obey what I command.',' Love obeys what Christ commands. Less than love does not. Is our love emotional bubbles or uncompromising obedience? Our living will express our love.',' How often my life contradicts my words. Forgive me, Lord. Teach me to love with Your love.'),(633,'That Incredible Christian','41',' Meditating on God','155','Looking at God','Among Christians of all ages and of varying shades of doctrinal emphasis there has been fairly full agreement on one thing: They all believed that it was important that the Christian with serious spiritual aspirations should learn to meditate long and often on God. Let a Christian insist upon rising above the poor average of current religious experience and he will soon come up against the need to know God Himself as the ultimate goal of all Christian doctrine. Let him seek to explore the sacred wonders of the Triune Godhead and he will discover that sustained and intelligently directed meditation on the Person of God is imperative. To know God well he must think on Him unceasingly. Nothing that man has discovered about himself or God has revealed any shortcut to pure spirituality. It is still free, but tremendously costly. Of course this presupposes at least a fair amount of sound theological knowledge. To seek God apart from His own self-disclosure in the inspired Scriptures is not only futile but dangerous. There must be also a knowledge of and complete trust in Jesus Christ as Lord and Redeemer. Christ is not one of many ways to approach God, nor is He the best of several ways; He is the only way. “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me” (John 14:6). To believe otherwise is to be something less than a Christian.','Psalm 104:34','May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.','Gerhard Tersteegen spoke of prayer as \"looking at God, who is ever present, and letting Him look at us.\" When did you last set aside time just to look at God and let Him look at you?','Lord, with Your Word open before me, I just want to spend time in looking at You and letting You look at me.'),(634,'That Incredible Christian','41',' Meditating on God','156',' Waiting for God','I am convinced that the dearth of great saints in these times even among those who truly believe in Christ is due at least in part to our unwillingness to give sufficient time to the cultivation of the knowledge of God. We of the nervous West are victims of the philosophy of activism tragically misunderstood. Getting and spending, going and returning, organizing and promoting, buying and selling, working and playing — this alone constitutes living. If we are not making plans or working to carry out plans already made we feel that we are failures, that we are sterile, unfruitful eunuchs, parasites on the body of society. The gospel of work, as someone has called it, has crowded out the gospel of Christ in many Christian churches. In an effort to get the work of the Lord done we often lose contact with the Lord of the work and quite literally wear our people out as well. I have heard more than one pastor boast that his church was a “live” one, pointing to the printed calendar as a proof — something on every night and several meetings during the day. Of course this proves nothing except that the pastor and the church are being guided by a bad spiritual philosophy. A great many of these time-consuming activities are useless and others plain ridiculous. “But,” say the eager beavers who run the religious squirrel cages, “they provide fellowship and they hold our people together.” To this I reply that what they provide is not fellowship at all, and if that is the best thing the church has to offer to hold the people together it is not a Christian church in the New Testament meaning of that word. The center of attraction in a true church is the Lord Jesus Christ. As for fellowship, let the Holy Spirit define it for us: “And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers” (Acts 2:42).',' Psalm 27:14','Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.','There is Master Planning and there is the Master\'s planning. May we not confuse the two. To know His plan requires waiting before Him. Then we can be strong and take heart.','Lord, I sometimes substitute activity for waiting. May I patiently wait on You to know Your plan.'),(635,'That Incredible Christian','41',' Meditating on God','157',' Pleasing Meditation',' The worldly man can never rest. He must have “somewhere to go’’ and “something to do.” This is a result of the fall, a symptom of a deep-lying disease, yet a blind religious leadership caters to this terrible restlessness instead of trying to cure it by the Word and the Spirit. If the many activities engaged in by the average church led to the salvation of sinners or the perfecting of believers they would justify themselves easily and triumphantly; but they do not. My observations have led me to the belief that many, perhaps most, of the activities engaged in by the average church do not contribute in any way the accomplishing of the true work of Christ on earth. I hope I am wrong, but I am afraid I am right. Our religious activities should be ordered in such a way as to leave plenty of time for the cultivation of the fruits of solitude and silence. It should be remembered, however, that it is possible to waste such quiet periods as we may be able to snatch for ourselves out of the clamorous day. Our meditation must be directed toward God; otherwise we may spend our time of retiral in quiet converse with ourselves. This may quiet our nerves but will not further our spiritual life in any way.',' Psalm 19:14',' May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.',' Our doing has value only as it expresses our being. Doing is easier than being. Being as God wants us comes from meditating upon Him our God, our Rock. He changes us.',' Forgive me, O God, from driving myself and other people. May I take time and encourage others to take time for meditation pleasing to You.'),(636,'That Incredible Christian','41',' Meditating on God','158','Being Still in God\'s Presence','In coming to God we should place ourselves in His presence with the confidence that He is the aggressor, not we. He has been waiting to manifest Himself to us till such time as our noise and activity have subsided enough for Him to make Himself heard and felt by us. Then we should focus our soul’s powers of attention upon the Triune Godhead. Whether One Person or Another claims our present interest is not important. We can trust the Spirit to bring before our minds the Person that we at the moment need most to behold. One thing more. Do not try to imagine God, or you will have an imaginary God; and certainly do not, as some have done, “set a chair for Him.” God is Spirit. He dwells in your heart, not your house. Brood on the Scriptures and let faith show you God as He is revealed there. Nothing else can equal this glorious sight.','Psalm 46:10','Be still, and know that I am God . . .','Slow down! Be still! How good to be still. The quieter in heart we become the more we know that He is God and He is there.','Teach me to be still, Lord. To be still and know that You are God.'),(637,'The Set of the Sail','1',' The Set of the Sail','1',' Determining to Follow the Lord',' That religion lies in the will is an axiom of theology. Not how we feel but what we will determines our spiritual direction. An old poem states it for us: \"One ship drives east and another drives west with the selfsame winds that blow; tis the set of the sails and not the gales which tells us the way to go\" (Ella Wheeler Wilcox}. Though we do not hear much of it in this age of spineless religion, there is nevertheless much in the Bible about the place of moral determination in the service of the Lord. Jacob vowed a vow, and it was the beginning of a very wonderful life with God. The following years brought a great many vicissitudes, and Jacob did not always acquit himself like a true man of God, but his early determination kept him on course, and he came through victorious at last. Daniel purposed in his heart, and God honored his purpose. Jesus set His face like a flint and walked straight toward the cross. Paul determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified,” and in that determined spirit ignored the learned philosophers, preached a gospel that was accounted foolishness and earned himself a reputation for ignorance, though he was easily the greatest brain of his generation. These are only a few of the many men and women of the Bible who have left us a record of spiritual greatness born out of a will firmly set to do the will of God. They did not try to float to heaven on a perfumed cloud, but cheerfully accepted the fact that with purpose of heart they must cleave unto the Lord.',' Daniel 1:8',' Daniel made up his mind to eat and drink only what God had approved for his people to eat . . . (Contemporary English Version).',' Determination alone cannot bring about life transformation. However, appropriation of the Spirit\'s empowerment cannot be experienced without determination on our part to so live.',' I choose Thee, blessed will of God! In Thee alone my heart can rest. That, too, is my choice, O Lord. By Your power strengthen my determination to persist in that choice!'),(638,'The Set of the Sail','1',' The Set of the Sail','2',' Setting Our Sails in the Will of God',' In the kingdom of God what we will is accepted as what we are. If any man will, said our Lord, let him. God does not desire to destroy our wills, but to sanctify them. In that terrible, wonderful moment of surrender it may be that we feel that our will has been forever broken, but such is not the case. In His conquest of the soul God does not destroy any of its normal powers. He purges the will and brings it into union with His own, but He never breaks it. In the diaries of some of God\'s greatest saints will be found vows and solemn pledges made in moments of great grace when the presence of God was so real and so wonderful that the reverent worshiper felt he dared to say anything, to make any promise, with the full assurance that God would enable him to carry out his holy intention. The self-confident and irresponsible boast of a Peter is one thing and is not to be confused with the hushed and trustful vow of a David or a Daniel. Neither should Peter\'s embarrassing debacle dissuade us from making vows of our own. The heart gives character to our pledges, and God knows the difference between an impulsive promise and a reverent declaration of intention. Let us, then, set our sails in the will of God. If we do this we will certainly find ourselves moving in the right direction, no matter which way the wind blows.',' Psalm 143:10',' Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.',' He will teach us to do His will if we are so committed. Sometimes He teaches us through painful experiences, even failures. Our need is for increased sensitivity to the Spirit\'s leading with determination to follow by His enablement.',' Lord, I set my sails in Your will. Lead me. Teach me. Strengthen me. I feel so weak!'),(639,'The Set of the Sail','2',' The Power of Silence','3',' God\'s Gentle Whisper','There are truths that can never be learned except in the noise and confusion of the market place or in the tough brutality of combat. The tumult and the shouting teach their own rough lessons. No man is quite a man who has not been to the school of work and war, who has not heard the cry at birth and the sigh at life\'s parting. But there is another school where the soul must go to learn its best eternal lessons. It is the school of silence. Be still and know, said the psalmist, and there is a profound philosophy there, of universal application. Prayer among evangelical Christians is always in danger of degenerating into a glorified gold rush. Almost every book on prayer deals with the get element mainly. How to get things we want from God occupies most of the space. Now, we gladly admit that we may ask for and receive specific gifts and benefits in answer to prayer, but we must never forget that the highest kind of prayer is never the making of requests. Prayer at its holiest moment is the entering into God to a place of such blessed union as makes miracles seem tame and remarkable answers to prayer appear something very far short of wonderful by comparison.',' 1 Kings 19:12-13','After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave.','We have so much to learn about heart stillness. To be calm and quiet smacks of inactivity, doing nothing. But cultivating heart stillness may be our most valuable activity because then we can hear God\'s gentle whisper.','Lord, help me to be quiet enough to hear Your gentle whisper. I look for You in the spectacular — the earthquakes and explosive fires. But You speak in the quiet, the calm. May I hear Your gentle whisper.'),(640,'The Set of the Sail','2',' The Power of Silence','4','Listening to God Before We Speak for Him','Holy men of soberer and quieter times than ours knew well the power of silence. David said, I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred. My heart was hot within me; while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue. There is a tip here for God\'s modern prophets. The heart seldom gets hot while the mouth is open. A closed mouth before God and a silent heart are indispensable for the reception of certain kinds of truth. No man is qualified to speak who has not first listened. It might well be a wonderful revelation to some Christians if they were to get completely quiet for a short time, long enough, let us say, to get acquainted with their own souls, and to listen in the silence for the deep voice of the Eternal God. The experience, if repeated often enough, would do more to cure our ulcers than all the pills that ever rolled across a desk.','John 10:27','My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.','The Good Shepherd speaks and His sheep listen to His voice. Some of us sheep are too busy \"baaing\" to listen to the Great Shepherd.','Father, may I be a friend to stillness. May I be a listener to You before daring to speak for You. In Jesus\' name.'),(641,'The Set of the Sail','3',' The Truth\'s Most Powerful Ally','5',' The Power of Godly Living',' The most effective argument for Christianity is still the good lives of those who profess it. A company of pure-living and cheerful Christians in the community is a stronger proof that Christ is risen than any learned treatise could ever be. And a further advantage is that, while the average person could not be hired to read a theological work, no one can evade the practical argument presented by the presence of holy men and women. To the sons and daughters of this tense and highly mechanized age a holy life may seem unpardonably dull and altogether lacking in interest, but among all the fancy, interest-catching toys of the world a holy life stands apart as the only thing slated to endure. The stars make no noise, says the Italian proverb; yet they have outlived all man\'s civilizations and in their unassuming silence have shone on through the centuries, preaching their simple doctrine of God and enduring things. Francis of Assisi composed some sublime hymns and preached some quaint sermons, but for none of these is he known and by none of these has he captured the moral imagination of mankind. The utter purity of his life it is which has won him a lasting place in the hearts of every seeker after God.',' 1 Thessalonians 4:7',' For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.',' Holy living gives authenticity to verbal witness. The impact of Christlike living opens the ears of those who otherwise would never listen. But it\'s easier to talk than to walk, isn\'t it?',' Change me, O Lord. Make me more and more like Jesus even if I whine and complain with the pain of change.'),(642,'The Set of the Sail','3',' The Truth\'s Most Powerful Ally','6',' The Holy are Humble','The Church in America suffered a greater loss than she has since discovered when she rejected the example of good men and chose for her pattern the celebrity of the hour. Human greatness cannot be determined by popularity polls nor by the number of lines any man rates in the public press. It is altogether unlikely that we know who our greatest men are. One thing is sure, however — the greatest man alive today is the best man alive today. That is not open to debate. To discover the good great man (granted that it would be to our profit to do so) would require more than human wisdom. For the holy man is also the humble man and the humble man will not advertise himself nor allow others to do it for him. Spiritual virtues run deep and silent. Like the tide or the pull of gravitation or the shining of the sun, they work without noise, but their gracious ministrations are felt around the whole earth. The Christian who is zealous to promote the cause of Christ can begin by living in the power of the Spirit and so reproducing the life of Christ in the sight of men. In deep humility and without ostentation he can let his light shine. The world may pretend not to see, but it will see, nevertheless, and more than likely it will get into serious trouble with its conscience over what it sees.',' Philippians 2:8','And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death — even death on a cross!','Andrew Murray wrote: \"Pride is the likeness of Satan, humility that of Jesus.\" Of the aspects of Christlikeness it is probably humility that is most foreign to contemporary American culture.','Lord, You humbled Yourself in degree I can never know. Yet the more I gaze upon You the more reason I have to be humble.'),(643,'The Set of the Sail','4',' We Are Committed to the Whole Message','7',' Gospel Corollaries',' To allow the gospel only its etymological meaning of good news is to restrict it so radically as actually to make it something it is not. That Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures is good news indeed. That He, having by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens from which exalted position He mediates grace to all believers, is wonderful, heartening news for the sin burdened race. But to limit the Christian message to this one truth alone is to rob it of much of its meaning and create a bad misunderstanding among those who hear the resultant preaching. The fact is that the New Testament message embraces a great deal more than an offer of free pardon. It is a message of pardon, and for that may God be praised; but it is also a message of repentance. It is a message of atonement, but it is also a message of temperance and righteousness and godliness in this present world. It tells us that we must accept a Savior, but it tells us also that we must deny ungodliness and worldly lusts. The gospel message includes the idea of amendment, of separation from the world, of cross carrying and loyalty to the kingdom of God even unto death. To be strictly technical, these latter truths are corollaries of the gospel, and not the gospel itself; but they are part and parcel of the total message which we are commissioned to declare. No man has authority to divide the truth and preach only a part of it. To do so is to weaken it and render it without effect.',' 2 Timothy 3:16-17',' All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.',' Accurate exegesis, interpretation, with close attention to textual and cultural context, all under the Spirit\'s guidance avoids erroneous teaching and misplaced emphasis.',' Make me a Berean, Lord, who receives Your Word with eagerness and examines the Scriptures daily to see if what I hear and teach is true.'),(644,'The Set of the Sail','4',' We Are Committed to the Whole Message','8',' Forgiveness for the Past and Provision for the Present',' . . . To offer a sinner the gift of salvation based upon the work of Christ, while at the same time allowing him to retain the idea that the gift carries with it no moral implications, is to do him untold injury where it hurts him worst. Many evangelical teachers insist so strongly upon free, unconditional grace as to create the impression that sin is not a serious matter and that God cares very little about it. He is concerned only with our escaping the consequences. The gospel then in practical application means little more than a way to escape the fruits of our past. The heart that has felt the weight of its own sin and along with this has seen the dread whiteness of the Most High God will never believe that a message of forgiveness without transformation is a message of good news. To remit a man\'s past without transforming his present is to violate the moral sincerity of his own heart. To that kind of thing God will be no party. We must have courage to preach the whole message. By so doing we shall undoubtedly lose a few friends and make a number of enemies. But the true Christian will not grieve too much about that. He has enough to do to please his Lord and Savior and to be true to the souls of all men. That may well occupy him too completely to leave much time for regrets over the displeasure of misguided men.',' Acts 20:27',' For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.',' Forgiveness for sins of the past and solid hope for the future are ours in Christ. Provision for the present is ours as well in the proclamation of the whole will of God. That will mean dealing with areas of life we have long tolerated but which displease God.',' Thank You for your patience and grace, Lord. Thank You, too, for the Spirit\'s insistent conviction. O God, continue to change me!'),(645,'The Set of the Sail','5',' I Believe in the Communion of Saints','9',' The Church: the Body of Christ',' The universal Church is the body of Christ, the bride of the Lamb, the habitation of God through the Spirit, the pillar and ground of the truth. The local church is a community of ransomed men, a minority group, a colony of heavenly souls dwelling apart on the earth, a division of soldiers on a foreign soil, a band of reapers, working under the direction of the Lord of the harvest, a flock of sheep following the Good Shepherd, a brotherhood of like-minded men, a visible representative of the Invisible God. It is most undesirable to conceive of our churches as Works, or Projects. If such words must be used, then let them be understood as referring to the earthly and legal aspect of things only. A true church is something supernatural and divine, and is in direct lineal descent from that first church at Jerusalem. Insofar as it is a church it is spiritual; its social aspect is secondary and may be imitated by any group regardless of its religious qualities or lack of them. The spiritual essence of a true church cannot be reproduced anywhere but in a company of renewed and inwardly united believers.',' Ephesians 1:22-23',' And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.',' That local church of which you are a part is one expression of the Church, the body of Christ. You cannot demand of other believers levels of Christlikeness and spiritual maturity that you yourself are not modeling. You are as much Church as are they.',' Father, thank You for the Church. Weak as I am and as my brothers and sisters are, we are members of the body of Christ. Your Spirit lives in us!'),(646,'The Set of the Sail','5',' I Believe in the Communion of Saints','10','We Need Church Family','The Christian life begins with the individual; a soul has a saving encounter with God and the new life is born. Not all the pooled efforts of any church can make a Christian out of a lost man. But once the great transaction\'s done the communion of believers will be found to be the best environment for the new life. Men are made for each other, and this is never more apparent than in the church. All else being equal, the individual Christian will find in the communion of a local church the most perfect atmosphere for the fullest development of his spiritual life. There also he will find the best arena for the largest exercise of those gifts and powers with which God may have endowed him. The religious solitary may gain on a few points, and he may escape some of the irritations of the crowd, but he is a half-man, nevertheless, and worse, he is a half-Christian. Every solitary experience, if we would realize its beneficial effects, should be followed immediately by a return to our own company. There will be found the faith of Christ in its most perfect present manifestation. But one thing must be kept in mind: these things are true only where the local church is a church indeed, where the communion of saints is more than a phrase from the Creed but is realized and practiced in faith and love. Those religio-social institutions, with which we are all too familiar, where worship is a form, the sermon an essay and the prayer an embarrassed address to someone who isn\'t there, certainly do not qualify as churches under any scriptural terms with which we are acquainted.','1 Corinthians 12:27','Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.','As believers we are interrelated and interdependent. Christ ministers to us through other believers and to other believers through us. He has gifted each of us to that end. We are members of Christ\'s body, the Church.','Amazing, Lord, that I am part of Your body, the Church! Thank You for ministering to me through other body members. May You minister to others through me. In Jesus\' name.'),(647,'The Set of the Sail','5',' I Believe in the Communion of Saints','11',' The Church is Our Spiritual Family',' The elements of a true church are few and easy to possess. They are a company of believers, the Lord, the Spirit and the Word of the Living God. Let the Lord be worshiped, the Spirit be obeyed, the Word be expounded and followed as the only rule for faith and conduct, and the power of God will begin to show itself as it did to Samson in the camp of Dan. The church will produce a spiritual culture all its own, wholly unlike anything created by the mind of man and superior to any culture known on earth, ancient or modern. God is getting His people ready for another world, and He uses the local church as a workshop in which to carry on His blessed work. That Christian is a happy one who has found a company of true believers in whose heavenly fellowship he can live and love and labor. And nothing else on earth should be as dear to him nor command from him such a degree of loyalty and devotion.',' First Peter 2:17',' Treat everyone you meet with dignity. Love your spiritual family. Revere God. Respect the government (The Message).',' Have we made the church just another social club? Do we sample selected ministries without submerging ourselves in the whole? Easy to do in a large church. But the church is our spiritual family.',' Forgive me, Lord, for judging my local church on the basis of what it contributes to me rather becoming fully a part. It is my spiritual family.'),(648,'The Set of the Sail','6',' We Must Try the Spirits','12',' Avoiding Deception',' These are times of moral and religious confusion and it is sometimes hard to distinguish the false from the true. Our faithful Lord has tried to save us from the consequences of our own blindness by repeated warnings and many careful instructions. It will pay us to give close attention to His words. Toward the end of the age, we are told, there shall be a time of stepped-up religious activity and frenzied expectation, growing out of the turbulent conditions prevailing among nations. The language is familiar to most Christians: Wars and rumors of wars . . . nation shall rise against nation . . famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. . . . Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations . . and then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. Concurrent with this state of affairs will be a great increase in religious excitement and supernatural happenings generally. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. . . . And many false prophets shall rise. . . . Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.',' Jude 17-19',' . . . remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold. They said to you, \'In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.\' These are the men who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not hav',' Our best defense against false teaching is the personal, systematic study of Scripture. We have access to the Word of God and the ministry of the indwelling Spirit. Let\'s exercise our privileges.',' O Lord, teach me from Your Word in these days of erroneous interpretation, mistaken contextualization and misapplication.'),(649,'The Set of the Sail','6',' We Must Try the Spirits','13',' Testing the Spirits',' Many tender-minded Christians fear to sin against love by daring to inquire into anything that comes wearing the cloak of Christianity and breathing the name of Jesus. They dare not examine the credentials of the latest prophet to hit their town lest they be guilty of rejecting something which may be of God. They timidly remember how the Pharisees refused to accept Christ when He came, and they do not want to be caught in the same snare, so they either reserve judgment or shut their eyes and accept everything without question. This is supposed to indicate a high degree of spirituality. But in sober fact it indicates no such thing. It may indeed be evidence of the absence of the Holy Spirit. Gullibility is not synonymous with spirituality. Faith is not a mental habit leading its possessor to open his mouth and swallow everything that has about it the color of the supernatural. Faith keeps its heart open to whatever is of God, and rejects everything that is not of God, however wonderful it may be. Try the spirits is a command of the Holy Spirit to the Church. We may sin as certainly by approving the spurious as by rejecting the genuine. And the current habit of refusing to take sides is not the way to avoid the question. To appraise things with a heart of love and then to act on the results is an obligation resting upon every Christian in the world. And the more as we see the day approaching.',' 1 John 4:1',' Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.',' Satan is clever in the use of disguise and deception. Denial that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is the major indicator that the spirits are not from God. Yet we must be on guard for lower level deception.',' Lord, give discernment and boldness lest I be derailed from truth and mired in error.'),(650,'The Set of the Sail','6',' We Must Try the Spirits','14',' Tests for Genuineness',' How can we tell whether or not a man or a religious demonstration is of God? The answer is easy to find, but it will take courage to follow the facts as God reveals them to us. The tests for spiritual genuineness are two: First, the leader must be a good man and full of the Holy Ghost. Christianity is nothing if not moral. No tricks of theology, no demonstrations of supernatural wonders, no evidences of blind devotion on the part of the public can decide whether or not God is in the man or the movement. Every servant of Christ must be pure of heart and holy of life. While sinless perfection is not likely to be found among even the best of men, still the leader to be trusted is the one who lives as near like Christ as possible and who knows how to repent in sorrow of heart when he sins against his Lord by any act or word. The man God honors will be humble, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, modest, clean living, free from the love of money, eager to promote the honor of God and just as eager to disclaim any credit or praise on his own part. His financial accounts will bear inspection, his ethical standards will be high and his personal life above reproach.',' Acts 11:24',' He [Barnabas] was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.',' Barnabas was an unusual encourager to the newly converted Paul, to John Mark and to the new believers in Antioch. He was, after all, a good person, full of the Holy Spirit and faith.',' Father, may I, too, be a good person, full of the Holy Spirit and faith.'),(651,'The Set of the Sail','6',' We Must Try the Spirits','15',' Applying the Test of Biblical Accuracy',' The tests for spiritual genuineness are two: First, the leader must be a good man and full of the Holy Ghost. Christianity is nothing if not moral. . . . But the test of moral goodness is not enough. Every man must submit his work to the scriptural test. It is not enough that he be able to quote from the Bible at great length or that he claim for himself great and startling experiences with God. Go back to the law and to the testimony. If he speak not according to the Word it is because there is no light in him. We who are invited to follow him have every right, as well as a solemn obligation, to test his work according to the Word of God. We must demand that every claimant for our confidence present a clean bill of health from the Holy Scriptures; that he do more than weave in a text occasionally, or hold up the Bible dramatically before the eyes of his hearers. His doctrines must be those of the Scriptures. The Bible must dominate his preaching. He must preach according to the Word of God. The price of following a false guide on the desert may be death. The price of heeding wrong advice in business may be bankruptcy. The price of trusting to a quack doctor may be permanent loss of health. The price of putting confidence in a pseudo-prophet may be moral and spiritual tragedy. Let us take heed that no man deceive us.',' 1 Thessalonians 5:19-21',' Do not put out the Spirit\'s fire; do not treat prophecies with contempt. Test everything. Hold on to the good.',' Applying the biblical test will mean accepting what is scripturally accurate and is from the Spirit and rejecting what is not. Needed is a growing knowledge of the Word and increasing sensitivity to the Spirit.',' Equip me to be a tester, Lord, to accurately yet graciously test what is taught in Your name.'),(652,'The Set of the Sail','7',' Facing Both Ways','16',' Blurred Goals and Spiritual Impediments',' Like a doctor with a sick patient whose disease eludes diagnosis, religious leaders have for some years been aware that there is something seriously wrong with evangelicalism and have yet been unable to lay their finger upon the precise trouble. The symptoms they have discovered in abundance, but the cause back of them has been hard to locate. Mostly we have spent our time correcting symptoms, having all the while an uneasy feeling that our remedies did not go deep enough. Knowing that a disease that cannot be identified invariably calls out a flock of untrained experts to analyze and prescribe, we yet risk a pronouncement upon the condition of evangelical Christianity in our day, and we believe we may not be too far from the truth. The trouble seems to be a disorder of the spiritual nerve system which we might, for the lack of a proper term, call dual orientation. Its dominant characteristic appears to be a cross up among the nerve ganglia of the soul resulting in an inability to control the direction of the life. The patient starts one direction and before he knows it he is going another. His inward eyes do not coordinate; each one sees a different object and seeks to lead the steps toward it. The individual is caught in the middle, trying to be true to both foci of the heart, and never knowing which he would rather follow. Evangelicalism (at least in many circles) is suffering from this strange division of life-purpose. Its theology faces toward the East and the sacred Temple of Jehovah. Its active interests face toward the world and the temple of Dagon. Doctrinally it is Christian, but actually it is pagan mentality, pagan scale of values and pagan religious principles.',' Hebrews 12:1',' Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.',' We seem to have forgotten that we are to throw off the hindrances (not sins) and the sin that so easily entangles us, if we are to run the race. Why do we try to run the Christian life marathon with a refrigerator strapped to our back?',' O Spirit of God, awaken me once again to those hindrances and that entangling sin that seriously impedes my progress in the race of life.'),(653,'The Set of the Sail','7',' Facing Both Way','17',' Radical Conversion',' Let a man but become, as the early Methodists would have said, soundly converted, and certain things will begin to happen in his life. He will experience a wonderful unification of personality and a turning about of the whole life toward God and heavenly things. Though he will undoubtedly suffer from the inward struggle described in the seventh chapter of Romans, yet his direction will be established beyond any doubt and his face will remain turned toward the City of God. That word direction should have more emphasis these days, for the most important thing about a life is its direction. David hardly said anything more significant than this: I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. And the Hebrews\' writer summed it all up in one sentence, Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. An emotional conversion which stops short of Christ-orientation is inadequate for life and death, and, unless new help comes from some quarter, it may easily be worse than no religious experience at all. And just this would appear to be the source of our bad orientation. The original experience of conversion was not sufficiently radical to turn the life wholly to God and things eternal. Then when religious leaders found that they had on their hands half-converted persons who wanted to be saved but would not turn fully to God, they tried to meet the situation by providing a twilight-zone religion which did not demand too much and which did offer something. Better have them halfway in, they reasoned, than all the way out. We know now how bad that reasoning was.',' Hebrews 12:2',' Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.',' We can\'t run the Christian race without fixing our eyes on Jesus. That involves taking our eyes off all else.',' Lord Jesus, You are the author and perfecter of my faith. I focus my heart eyes on You. By Your Spirit I want to run this life marathon with perseverance.'),(654,'The Set of the Sail','7',' Facing Both Ways','18',' No Turning Back',' With large blocks of evangelicals praying and preaching like Christians while they live and talk like worldlings, how much longer may we expect them to remain evangelical? Apostasy always begins with the conduct. First there is a wrong orientation of the life, a facing toward the lost world with yearning and enjoyment; later there comes a gradual surrender of the truth itself and a slipping back into unbelief. That has happened to individuals and denominations and it can happen to the whole present evangelical communion if it is not checked before it is too late. For this cause, the facing-both-ways attitude of our present Christianity is something to be alarmed about. And if that attitude were the result of plain backsliding there would be much more reason for optimism. Unchristian acts done by a Christian through weakness and over the protests of his better heart may be bad enough, but they are not likely to be fatal. But when he does them with the sanction of his teachers and with the belief that they are all a part of the Christian way, how is he to be rescued?',' John 6:66',' From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.',' There is turning back which is deliberate and decisive. There is also that which is gradual and almost insensible. It is the latter to which we may be most vulnerable. We are in the world. Are we of it, too?',' I am in this world but, Lord, I don\'t want to be of it. Help me to discern the difference.'),(655,'The Set of the Sail','8',' What Profit in Prayer?','19',' Prayer and Faith',' The skeptic in the book of Job asked the disdainful question, What is the Almighty, that we should serve him, and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? The whole tone of the remark shows that it is meant to be rhetorical. The doubter, believing the question could have no answer, tossed it off contemptuously and turned away, like Pilate, without waiting for a reply. But we have an answer. God Himself has supplied it, and the universal consensus of the ages has added an Amen. In the eleventh chapter of Hebrews we have a long list of benefits which faith brings to its possessors: justification, deliverance, fruitfulness, endurance, victory over enemies, courage, strength and even resurrection from the dead. And everything that is attributed to faith might with equal truth be attributed to prayer, for faith and true prayer are like two sides of the same coin. They are inseparable.',' Mark 11:24',' Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.',' We are instructed to not only ask in prayer but to believe we have received it. Our \"asking\" greatly exceeds our \"believing.\" But the two are inseparable parts of the whole.',' Father, forgive me for asking without believing. You, Lord, invite me to ask but to do so while believing.'),(656,'The Set of the Sail','8',' What Profit in Prayer?','20',' Believing Prayer',' Men may, and often do, pray without faith (though this is not true prayer), but it is not thinkable that men should have faith and not pray. The biblical formula is The prayer of faith. Prayer and faith are here bound together by the little preposition of, and what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. Faith is only genuine as it eventuates into prayer. When Tennyson wrote More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of, he probably uttered a truth of vaster significance than even he understood. While it is not always possible to trace an act of God to its prayer-cause, it is yet safe to say that prayer is back of everything that God does for the sons of men here upon earth. One would gather as much from a simple reading of the Scriptures. What profit is there in prayer? Much every way. Whatever God can do faith can do, and whatever faith can do prayer can do when it is offered in faith. An invitation to prayer is, therefore, an invitation to omnipotence, for prayer engages the Omnipotent God and brings Him into our human affairs. Nothing is impossible to the man who prays in faith, just as nothing is impossible with God. This generation has yet to prove all that prayer can do for believing men and women.',' Matthew 7:7-8',' Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.',' Why would God invite, even command us to pray if He were not going to answer? He is ready to answer. It is for us to pray in faith according to His revealed will, persevere in prayer and leave the means and the timing to Him.',' Grow me, Lord, to be a person of faithful, faith-filled prayer. May I make prayer my major ministry.'),(657,'The Set of the Sail','8',' What Profit in Prayer?','21',' Faith Grows with Use','It was a saying of George Mueller that faith grows with use. If we would have great faith we must begin to use the little faith we already have. Put it to work by reverent and faithful praying, and it will grow and become stronger day by day. Dare today to trust God for something small and ordinary and next week or next year you may be able to trust Him for answers bordering on the miraculous. Everyone has some faith, said Mueller; the difference among us is one of degree only, and the man of small faith may be simply the one who has not dared to exercise the little faith he has. According to the Bible, we have because we ask, or we have not because we ask not. It does not take much wisdom to discover our next move. Is it not to pray, and pray again and again till the answer comes? God waits to be invited to display His power in behalf of His people. The world situation is such that nothing less than God can straighten it out. Let us not fail the world and disappoint God by failing to pray.',' Colossians 4:2','Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.','Said Wesley Deuwel: \"Prayer is not limited to the humanly possible. Prayer is a work of faith. The purpose of prevailing prayer is to bring to pass things that are divinely possible and that are in God\'s will. . . . He has chosen to make us His co-labore','Father, what unbelievable resources You have given me — prayer, believing prayer. I can touch the world through prayer. May I grow in faith as I believingly pray.'),(658,'The Set of the Sail','9',' The True Saint Is Different','22',' On Being Different',' The Church\'s mightiest influence is felt when she is different from the world in which she lives. Her power lies in her being different, rises with the degree in which she differs and sinks as the difference diminishes. This is so fully and clearly taught in the Scriptures and so well illustrated in Church history that it is hard to see how we can miss it. But miss it we do, for we hear constantly that the Church must try to be as much like the world as possible, excepting, of course, where the world is too, too sinful; and we are told to get adjusted to the world and be all things to all men. (This use of the passage, incidentally, points up Peter\'s saying that Our beloved brother Paul wrote some things which the unlearned and the unstable wrest to their own destruction.) One sure mark of the Church\'s heavenly character is that she is different from the rest of mankind; similarity is a mark of her fall. The sons of God and the sons of men are morally and spiritually separated, and between them there is a great gulf fixed. When religious persons try to bridge that gulf by compromise they violate the very principles of the kingdom of God.',' John 15:19',' If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.',' How much are we hated by the world not because of personal peculiarities or hypocrisy but because of likeness to Christ? The world hated Christ. What is its attitude to us?',' Lord, in seeking to love the people of the world may I clearly reject the world\'s values and practices. I am Yours not theirs.'),(659,'The Set of the Sail','9',' The True Saint Is Different','23',' Refusing to be Conformed to the Pattern of This World',' Men are impressed with the message of the Church just as far and as long as she is different from themselves. When she seeks to be like them they no longer respect her. They believe (and rightly) that she is playing false to herself and to them. The moral jar that results when an indoctrinated son of Adam meets a son of heaven is one of the most wholesome things that can happen to both of them. And contrary to common opinion, men are more inclined to follow the way of Christ when they are compelled to make a radical alteration in their lives than they are when the way is made easy for them. The human heart senses its need to be changed, and when religion appears offering life without such change, it is not taken seriously by thinking men. The superficial, the insincere, may embrace such a low-powered brand of religion, but the seeking heart must reject it as false and unreal. All conformity to the world is a negation of our Christian character and a surrender of our heavenly position.',' Romans 12:2',' Don\'t let the world around you squeeze into its own mould, but let God re-mould your minds from within . . . (Phillips Translation).',' In our efforts to be \"seeker friendly\" there is the danger of downplaying the radical nature of conversion, the cost to the sinful nature of daily cross-carrying, and separation from this world. For the child of God there is heavenly citizenship. This wo',' O God, may You express Your love through me to the people of this world, yet keep me being squeezed into this world\'s mould.'),(660,'The Set of the Sail','9',' The True Saint Is Different','24',' Embracing the Cross of Christ','Let us plant ourselves on the hill of Zion and invite the world to come over to us, but never under any circumstances will we go over to them. The cross is the symbol of Christianity, and the cross speaks of death and separation, never of compromise. No one ever compromised with a cross. The cross-separated between the dead and the living. The timid and the fearful will cry Extreme! and they will be right. The cross is the essence of all that is extreme and final. The message of Christ is a call across a gulf from death to life, from sin to righteousness and from Satan to God. The first step for any Christian who is seeking spiritual power is to accept his unique position as a son of heaven temporarily detained on the earth, and to begin to live as becometh a saint. The sharp line of demarcation between him and the world will appear at once — and the world will never quite forgive him. And the sons of earth will make him pay well for separation, but it is a price he will gladly pay for the privilege of walking in fruitfulness and power.',' Galatians 6:14','May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.','The cross of Christ marks an unbridgeable gulf between the believer and the world. Paul clearly understood that his embrace of the cross of Christ meant unmistakable severance from this world. Do we?','May my faith identification with You, O Christ, welcome Your life in me and my death to this world system. For Your glory!'),(661,'The Set of the Sail','10',' Faith Rests upon God\'s Character','25',' Our Faith Reflects Our Concept of God',' All things else being equal, the destiny of a man or nation may safely be predicted from the idea of God which that man or that nation holds. No nation can rise higher than its conception of God. While Rome held to her faith in the stern old gods of the Pantheon she remained an iron kingdom. Her citizens unconsciously imitated the character of her gods, however erroneous their conception of the Deity might have been. When Rome began to think loosely about God she began to rot inwardly, and that rot never stopped till it brought her to the ground. So it must always be with men and nations. A church is strong or weak just as it holds to a high or low idea of God. For faith rests not primarily upon promises, but upon character. A believer\'s faith can never rise higher than his conception of God. A promise is never better or worse than the character of the one who makes it. An inadequate conception of God must result in a weak faith, for faith depends upon the character of God just as a building rests upon its foundation. This explains why unbelief is such a grievous sin; it is pure libel against the Lord of heaven and earth. Unbelief judges God to be unworthy of confidence and withholds its trust from Him. Can there be a more heinous sin than this? He that believeth not God hath made him a liar” (1 John 5:10). Our hearts shrink from the full implications of such a statement, but would not this seem to teach that unbelief attributes to God the character of Satan? Jesus said of Satan, He is a liar and the father of it. Unbelief says virtually the same thing of God.',' Romans 11:33-36',' Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \'Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? Who has ever given to God that God should repay him?\' Fo',' How big is our God? Our prayer, our daily life, our worship reflect our concept of God. Let\'s let God be GOD in our life!',' O God, forgive me for my small concept of You. In increasing measure show me who You are! In Jesus\' name.'),(662,'The Set of the Sail','10',' Faith Rests upon God\'s Character','26',' Prayerful Digestion of God\'s Word','How then shall unbelief be cured and faith be strengthened? Surely not by straining to believe the Scriptures, as some do. Not by a frantic effort to believe the promises of God. Not by gritting our teeth and determining to exercise faith by an act of the will. All this has been tried — and it never helps. To try thus to superinduce faith is to violate the laws of the mind and to do violence to the simple psychology of the heart. What is the answer? Job told us, Acquaint thyself with him and be at peace; and Paul said, So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. These two verses show the way to a strong and lasting faith: Get acquainted with God through reading the Scriptures, and faith will come naturally. This presupposes that we come to the Scriptures humbly, repudiating self-confidence and opening our minds to the sweet operations of the Spirit. Otherwise stated: Faith comes effortlessly to the heart as we elevate our conceptions of God by a prayerful digestion of His Word. And such faith endures, for it is grounded upon the Rock.',' Hebrews 4:12','For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.','Prayerfully submerging ourselves in the Word results in increasing obedience, growing faith and expanding concept of God. Let\'s get into the Word and let the Word get into us!','Lord, open my heart eyes to You as I feed on Your Word. By Your Spirit show me more and more who You are.'),(663,'The Set of the Sail','11',' Salvation Walks the Earth','27',' The Quiet Call of Christ','It is like the Lord to fasten a world upon nothing, and make it stay in place. Here He takes that wonderful, mysterious microcosm we call the human soul and makes its future weal or woe to rest upon a single word — if. If any man, He says, and teaches at once the universal inclusiveness of His invitation, and the freedom of the human will. Everyone may come; no one need come, and whoever does come, comes because he chooses to. Every man holds his future in his hand. Not the dominant world leader only, but the inarticulate man lost in anonymity is a man of destiny. He decides which way his soul shall go. He chooses, and destiny waits on the nod of his head. He decides, and hell enlarges herself, or heaven prepares another mansion. So much of Himself has God given to men. There is a strange beauty in the ways of God with men. He sends salvation to the world in the person of a Man and sends that Man to walk the busy ways saying, If any man will come after me. No drama, no fanfare, no tramp of marching feet or tumult of shouting. A kindly Stranger walks through the earth, and so quiet is His voice that it is sometimes lost in the hurly-burly; but it is the last voice of God, and until we become quiet to hear it we have no authentic message. He bears good tidings from afar but He compels no man to listen. If any man will, He says, and passes on. Friendly, courteous, unobtrusive, He yet bears the signet of the King. His word is divine authority, His eyes a tribunal, His face a last judgment.',' Matthew 11:28','Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.','In Gerhard Tersteegen\'s words: \"God calling yet! And shall He knock and I my heart the closer lock? He still is waiting to receive, and shall I dare His Spirit grieve?\" God is calling us and those around us.','Thank You, Lord, for patiently calling me. I have come to You.

So the gulf opens between man and man, between those who will and those who will not. Silently, terribly the work goes on, as each one decides whether he will hear or ignore the voice of invitation. Unknown to the world, perhaps unknown even to the individual, the work of separation takes place. Each hearer of the Voice must decide for himself, and he must decide on the basis of the evidence the message affords. There will be no thunder sound, no heavenly sign or light from heaven. The Man is His own proof. The marks in His hands and feet are the insignia of His rank and office. He will not put Himself again on trial; He will not argue, but the morning of the judgment will confirm what men in the twilight have decided. And those who would follow Him must accept His conditions. Let him, He says, and there is no appeal from His words. He will use no coercion, but neither will He compromise. Men cannot make the terms; they merely agree to them. Thousands turn from Him because they will not meet His conditions. He watches them as they go, for He loves them, but He will make no concessions. Admit one soul into the Kingdom by compromise and that Kingdom is no longer secure. Christ will be Lord, or He will be Judge. Every man must decide whether he will take Him as Lord now or face Him as Judge then.',' Matthew 16:24',' Then Jesus said to his disciples, \'If ayone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\'',' Christ makes clear the way to follow Him.

If He is to save the man, He must save him from himself. It is the himself which has enslaved and corrupted the man. Deliverance comes only by denial of that self. No man in his own strength can shed the chains with which self has bound him, but in the next breath the Lord reveals the source of the power which is to set the soul free: Let him take up his cross. The cross has gathered in the course of the years much of beauty and symbolism, but the cross of which Jesus spoke had nothing of beauty in it. It was an instrument of death. Slaying men was its only function. Men did not wear that cross; but that cross wore men. It stood naked until a man was pinned on it, a living man fastened like some grotesque stickpin on its breast to writhe and groan till death stilled and silenced him. That is the cross. Nothing less. And when it is robbed of its tears and blood and pain it is the cross no longer. Let him take . . . his cross, said Jesus, and in death he will know deliverance from himself.',' Galatians 2:20','I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God.','The cross we are to carry is not a church steeple or a decorative emblem to be worn around the neck. The cross is an instrument of \"me\" death so that Christ may live in us.','Lord, we have made the cross so beautiful and decorative but it remains an instrument of death — \"me\" death so that I may live in You and You may live in me. I need that cross today.'),(666,'The Set of the Sail','11',' Salvation Walks the Earth','30',' Daily Following','A strange thing under the sun is crossless Christianity. The cross of Christendom is a no-cross, an ecclesiastical symbol. The cross of Christ is a place of death. Let each one be careful which cross he carries. And follow me. Now the glory begins to break in upon the soul that has just returned from Calvary. Follow me is an invitation, and a challenge, and a promise. The cross has been the end of a life and the beginning of a life. The life that ended there was a life of sin and slavery; the life that began there is a life of holiness and spiritual freedom. And follow me, He says, and faith runs on tiptoe to keep pace with the advancing light. Until we know the program of our risen Lord for all the years to come we can never know everything He meant when He invited us to follow Him. Each heart can have its own dream of fair worlds and new revelations, of the odyssey of the ransomed soul in the ages to come, but whoever follows Jesus will find at last that He has made the reality to outrun the dream.',' Luke 14:27','And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.','We\'re to follow Christ while carrying our cross. Our way of saying \"no\" to the old nature and \"yes\" to Him. In staying close to Him, we enter an increasingly new life — His.','Lord, I find myself trying to disguise that death-instrument cross in gold and redefining disciple to be less than a follower.

I want to live a life of \"no\" to me and \"yes\" to You.'),(667,'The Set of the Sail','12',' God\'s Love and Ours','31',' God Love',' God being who and what He is must love Himself with pure and perfect love. The Persons of the Godhead love each other with a love so fiery, so tender, that it is all a burning flame of intense desire ineffable. God is Himself the only being whom He can love directly; all else that He loves is for His own sake and because He finds some reflection of Himself there . God loves His mute creation because He sees in it an imperfect representation of His own wisdom and power. He loves the angels and seraphim because He sees in them some likeness of His holiness. He loves men because He beholds in them a fallen relic of His own image. Potentially God loves all men alike, but His active love lights upon some men more than upon others, the degree depending upon how much of Himself He is able to impart to them. The truly Christlike soul enjoys more of God\'s love because God sees in it a truer image of Himself than in a soul less purified. God loves His Son with infinite perfection because He is the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person.',' 1 John 4:10',' This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.',' God\'s love is so far beyond any love we have known that it staggers the mind even to contemplate it. Yet we are objects of that love. May we also be conveyors of it.',' Lord, I am an object of Your perfect, holy love. Insofar as is possible for an imperfect human, may I be a conveyor of Your love.'),(668,'The Set of the Sail','12',' God\'s Love and Ours','32',' On Becoming More Lovable',' God desires that all men should become Christlike, for in so doing they present larger and more perfect objects for the reception of His outpoured love. Conformity to the nature of Christ on the part of a redeemed man restores the image of God in the soul and thus makes it possible for God to lavish on the soul without restraint all the boundless love of which He is the original fountain. It is hard for a sinful man to believe that God loves Him. His own accusing conscience tells him it could not be so. He knows that he is an enemy of God and alienated in his mind through wicked works, and he sees in himself a thousand moral discrepancies that unfit him for the just enjoyment of so pure a love. Yet the whole Bible proclaims the love of God for sinful men. We must believe in His love because He declares it and avail ourselves of the sanctifying grace of Christ in order to receive and enjoy that love to the full.',' 1 John 3:1',' How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And this is what we are! . . .',' God loves us! We stare in the mirror and cry out in amazement, \"how can it be that He loves me?\" Let\'s not question it but rather fully open ourselves to that love that we might be changed by the Lover.',' I want to soak in Your love, Father, as much as it is possible. In no way am I worthy. Yet You love me, You love ME! Hallelujah!'),(669,'The Set of the Sail','12',' God\'s Love and Ours','33',' To Know God is to Love Him',' God is love, and is for that reason the source of all the love there is. He has set as the first of all commandments that we love Him with all our hearts, but He knows that the desired love can never originate with us. We love him, because he first loved us, is the scriptural and psychological pattern. We can love Him as we ought only as He inflames our minds with holy desire. Yet there is also a love of willing as well as of feeling. Though we may not be conscious of any great degree of inward sensation, we may set our wills to love God and the feeling will come of itself. Let us bring ourselves under obedience to His revealed Word and our love for Him will grow. Obedience will strengthen faith and faith will increase knowledge. And it is a well-known law of the spiritual life that our love for God will spring up and flourish just as our knowledge of Him increases. To know Him is to love Him, and to know Him better is to love Him more.',' 1 John 4:19',' We love because he first loved us.',' God is love. The more we know Him the more we will love Him. To know Him is to love Him.',' O Father, may I know You better and love You more. In Jesus\' name.'),(670,'The Set of the Sail','13',' The Lord Giveth Knowledge','34',' The \"Exegete\" of the Father',' Elsewhere I have said that we cannot know God by thinking, but that we must do a lot of thinking if we would know Him well. This sounds self-contradictory, but I am sure that the two statements are in full accord with each other. The inability of the human mind to know God in a true and final sense is taken for granted throughout the Bible and even taught in plain words in such passages as these: No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. The world by wisdom knew not God. The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. God\'s nature is of another kind from anything with which the mind is acquainted; hence when the mind attempts to find out God it is confronted by obscurity. It is surrounded with mystery and blinded by the light no man can approach unto. A consideration of this truth led some thinkers of the past to conclude that since it is impossible for man to discover God by means of any faculties he possesses, God must therefore remain not only unknown but unknowable. What these men overlooked was that when God desires He can and does reveal Himself to men. The Spirit of God is able to make the spirit of man know and experience the awful mystery of God\'s essential being. It should be noted that the Spirit reveals God to the spirit of man, not to his intellect merely. The intellect can know God\'s attributes because these constitute that body of truth that can be known about God. The knowledge of God is for the spirit alone. Such knowledge comes not by intellection but by intuition .',' John 1:18',' No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father\'s side, has made him known.',' The Greek term translated \"made him known\" is related to the word from which we get \"exegesis.\" Christ has \"exegeted,\" clearly made known to us the Father. Christ reflects the Father.',' The more I gaze upon You, Lord, the more I know the Father. You are the Revealer of the Father.'),(671,'The Set of the Sail','13',' The Lord Giveth Knowledge','35',' The Divine Illuminator',' To know God in the scriptural meaning of the term is to enter into experience of Him. It never means to know about. It is not a knowledge mediated by the intellect, but an unmediated awareness experienced by the soul on a plane too high for the mind to reach. Where then is the place of the intellect in Christian experience? And why waste time thinking when we know beforehand that thought cannot bring us to the knowledge that is most of all to be desired, the knowledge of God? The answer is that the whole biblical revelation is addressed to the intellect and through the intellect reaches the will, the seat of the moral life; if the will responds in repentance and obedience, the Holy Spirit illuminates the penitent heart and reveals Christ, the image of God, to it. What began as an appeal to reason (Isaiah 1:18) ends in a spiritual experience wholly above reason.',' John 16:13-14',' But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mind and making it known',' The Holy Spirit makes known to us what is Christ\'s. He is the Divine Illuminator enlightening the mind and heart of the believer. May that light shine brightly in each of us!',' How I need heart illumination, Lord, to know You and Your Word. Thank You for sending the Spirit, the Divine Illuminator!'),(672,'The Set of the Sail','13',' The Lord Giveth Knowledge','36',' When the Heart Lights Go On',' God is concerned with the whole man and has designed that Christian experience should embrace the entire personality. The Christian faith deals not with the spiritual only but with the moral and the rational as well. The rational and moral elements in religion are the proper objects of thought and willingly yield their rich treasures to prayerful meditation. The Christian faith deals with God and man and what can be known about them and their relation one to the other. It contemplates creation, redemption, righteousness, sacred history, the destiny of mankind and the future of the world. Such truths, once they have been revealed by divine inspiration, lie where they can be got at by the redeemed intellect and wait to be exploited by the sons of the kingdom. Under the illumination and guidance of the Holy Spirit the prayerful, studious believer can become a Christian philosopher, a sage, a doctor of divine things. More than that, he can become a man of God and a light to his generation. I repeat, we cannot know God by thinking alone, but we can never know Him very well without a lot of hard thinking.',' Luke 24:45',' Then He opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.',' As the Spirit illumines our minds we can understand truth and know God. Heart lights go on! We can see! He is the difference between closed minds and open ones.',' Open my mind, Spirit of God, to understand the Scriptures and the One who speaks through them.'),(673,'The Set of the Sail','14',' The Urge to Share','37',' Imitating the Imitators of God',' Spiritual experiences must be shared. It is not possible for very long to enjoy them alone. The very attempt to do so will destroy them. The reason for this is obvious. The nearer our souls draw to God the larger our love will grow, and the greater our love the more unselfish we shall become and the greater our care for the souls of others. Hence increased spiritual experience, so far as it is genuine, brings with it a strong desire that others may know the same grace that we ourselves enjoy. This leads quite naturally to an increased effort to lead others to a closer and more satisfying fellowship with God. The human race is one. God made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and He made the individual members of society for each other. Not the hermit but the man in the midst of society is in the place best to fulfill the purpose for which he was created. There may be circumstances when for a time it will be necessary for the seeker after God to wrestle alone like Jacob on the bank of the river, but the result of his lonely experience is sure to flow out to family and friend, and on out to society at last. In the nature of things it must be so.',' Ephesians 5:1-2',' Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.',' What encouragement and challenge exudes from that believer who lives in the fullness of Christ even in the face of this worlds chilling winds; who demonstrates peace and joy of heart even in severe pain and suffering. Such believers show us the way.',' Thank You, Lord, for those of Your people who live a life of love in the most adverse circumstances. In doing so, they provide a model to the rest of us of what You can do when we give ourselves wholly to You.'),(674,'The Set of the Sail','14',' The Urge to Share','38',' Sharing the Good News',' The impulse to share, to impart, normally accompanies any true encounter with God and spiritual things. The woman at the well, after her soul-inspiring meeting with Jesus, left her water pots, hurried into the city and tried to persuade her friends to come out and meet Him. Come, see a man, she said, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? Her spiritual excitement could not be contained within her own heart. She had to tell someone. Is it not possible that our Lord had this in mind when He spoke about the impossibility of secret discipleship? Have we misunderstood the true relationship between faith and testimony? Christ made it clear that there could be no such thing as secret discipleship and Paul said, With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. This is usually understood to mean that God has laid upon us an arbitrary requirement to open our mouth in confession before salvation can become effective within us. Maybe that is the correct meaning of these verses. Or could it be that the confession is an evidence of the salvation which has come by faith to the heart, and where there is no impulse to impart, no outrushing of words in joyous testimony, there has been no true inward experience of saving grace?',' John 9:24-25',' A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. Give glory to God, they said. We know this man is a sinner. He replied, Whether he is a sinner or not, I dont know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see.',' If once we were blind but now we see, the evidence ought to be in our daily life. And if we once were blind but now we can see, ought we not share with other blind people the Good News about the One who opens blinded eyes?',' Lord, I cant open the eyes of the blind but You can! Shine Your light through me to those in darkness. In Jesus name.'),(675,'The Set of the Sail','14',' The Urge to Share','39',' Praise Reporters',' The irrepressible urge to share spiritual blessings can explain a great many religious phenomena. It even goes so far as to create a kind of vicarious transfer of interest from one person to another, so that the blessed soul would if necessary give up its own blessing that another might receive. Only thus can that prayer of Moses be understood, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written (Exodus 32:31, 32). His great care for Israel had made him incautious, almost rash, before the Lord in their behalf. Moses felt that for Israel to be forgiven was reward enough for him. This impulsive uprush of vicarious love can hardly be defended before the bar of pure reason. But God understood and complied with Moses request. The intense urge to have others enjoy the same spiritual privileges as himself once led Paul to make a statement so extreme, so reckless, that reason cannot approve it; only love can understand: I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh (Romans 9:1-3). In the light of this it is quite easy to understand why all great Christian teachers have insisted that true spiritual experience must be shared. The careless person who remarks that he does not need to go to church to serve God is far from understanding the most elementary spiritual truths. By cutting himself off from the religious community he proves that he has never felt the deep urge to share-and for the very reason that he has nothing to share. He has never felt the constraining love of Christ, so he can go his way in silence. His withdrawal from the believing fellowship tells us more about him than he knows about himself. Being let go, they went to their own company. So it was in the Early Church and so it has always been when men meet God in saving encounter. They want to share the blessed benefits.',' Acts 4:23-24a',' On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. . . .',' Sharing with other believers serious needs is fuel for prayer to God. Sharing what God has done in answer to prayer lights the fire of joy and praise. These are family celebrations!',' Lord, when I hear of what You have done and are doing in the lives of brothers and sisters I am encouraged to trust You for my heart needs. May I, too, be sharer with Your family.'),(676,'The Set of the Sail','15',' Dedication to What?','40',' Whatever Happened to Dedication?',' It is one of the ironies of modern life that after a word has been dropped from the Christian vocabulary because it no longer expresses any vital content in current church religion, it is often taken up by the world and made to mean not the same thing but something close to what it once meant in its original Christian usage. Such a word is dedicate. This word in its various forms was once used to express a sacred idea deriving straight from the Scriptures. . . . Now I have no quarrel with mere words. Whatever current usage and an up-to-date dictionary declare a word to mean, that is what it means, whatever it may have meant before. But I am concerned when men mistake earth for heaven, confuse this world with the world to come and borrow sacred words to describe secular things-without knowing what they have done. That is precisely what has happened to the word dedication. Through a radical change of meaning it has been lost to the language of worship. And it is highly significant that up to this moment Christians have not felt sufficient inward pressure to create a new word that would mean what the old word once meant. Apparently not only the word is gone from us but the idea as well. One reason for this is the current imperfect understanding of the Christian message. Scarcely anyone catches the imperious note in Christs words. The Christian message has ceased to be a pronouncement and has become a proposition. Its invitational element has been pressed far out of proportion in the total scriptural scheme. Christ with His lantern, His apologetic stance and His weak pleading face has taken the place of the true Son of Man whom John saw clothed with a garment down to the foot, girt with a golden girdle, whose head and hair are white like wool, whose eyes are as a flame of fire, whose feet are like burnished brass and whose voice is as the sound of many waters. The Christ of the tentative smile and air of puzzlement is not the Christ of God. The artists have been guilty of inadvertent idolatry in presenting to the world a false image of Christ. Only the Holy Spirit can reveal our Lord as He really is, and He does not paint in oils. He manifests Christ to the human spirit, not to our physical eyes.',' John 16:14',' He [the Holy Spirit] will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you.',' Only the Holy Spirit can reveal Christ to us as He really is because only the Spirit can take what is Christs and make it known to us. When we know Christ as He is in His person and glory, then we will give ourselves wholly to Him.',' O Christ, we humans have cheapened You. We have sought to reduce You to our level. Forgive us! Forgive me! May Your Spirit reveal You to me.'),(677,'The Set of the Sail','15',' Dedication to What?','41',' Completely Dedicated to Christ: Are We?',' The truth is, dedication of the life to any thing or anyone short of God Himself, is a prostitution of noble powers and must bring a harvest of grief and disappointment at last. Only God is worthy of the soul He has made in His own image. To devote our lives to any cause, however worthy, is to sell ourselves short. Not money, position, fame, can justly claim our devotion. Art, literature, music also fall short. And, if God is forgotten, even the loftiest and most unselfish task is unworthy of the souls full surrender. Complete dedication unto death in the cause of freedom, for instance, is a touching thing and has given to history many of her greatest heroes, but only the God of freedom should have our last full measure of devotion. These are strenuous times and men are being recruited everywhere to devote themselves to one or another master. Let us be careful. No one has any true right to claim my life except the One who gave His own life for my redemption. If He gets my full dedication then I may engage in any good and worthy cause under His Spirit\'s guidance. But anything short of complete devotion to Christ is inadequate and must end in futility and loss.',' Psalm 139:23-24',' Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.',' Complete dedication to Christ. We feel it in those highly emotional crises of life. But full dedication lived out by is often elusive. Yet to know Him fully we must give ourselves fully to Him.',' O God, forgive me for dedication that is thin and limited. I want to surrender myself wholly to You. Show me those areas still unsurrendered.'),(678,'The Set of the Sail','16',' The Making of a Man','42',' That Magnificent Gift of Thought',' Though human nature as we know it now is fallen and morally degenerate, it yet stands at the top in the order of Gods creation. Of no other being was it said, In the image of God created he him. Mans nature indicates that he was created for three things: To think, to worship and to work. Under think may be included everything that the intellect can do, from the simplest act to the creation of an oratorio or the founding of an empire. In his ability to observe, to inquire, to collect data and to reason from it to causes, laws and principles, man stands easily supreme above all other creatures. The domestication of the wild forces of nature, the conquest of disease, the amelioration of the pains and woes of our physical organism-all has been done by the thinking man riding on the wings of his imagination out into the unknown and daring to entertain notions no one had entertained before. To make out of the raw material that is a man a thinking man, an imaginative, dreaming man, is one of the most urgent tasks of society. This task begins in the nursery and goes on through to the university. Whatever institution, large or small, famous or obscure, dedicates itself to the necessary and heavy job of teaching men to think deserves the gratitude of the whole human race.',' Colossians 3:1-2',' Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your minds on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.',' What an amazing ability is that of thinking. What we set our minds on, to a large degree, charts our course and determines whether our fallen nature or the Holy Spirit dictates our living.',' Thank You, Father, for the gift of thinking. By Your Sprit remind me to set my mind on things above. Too often I concentrate on the earthly.'),(679,'The Set of the Sail','16',' The Making of a Man','43',' We Were Made to Worship',' Mans nature indicates that he was created for three things: To think, to worship and to work. But thinking is not enough. Men are made to worship also, to bow down and adore in the presence of the Mystery inexpressible. Mans mind is not the top peak of his nature. Higher than his mind is his spirit, that something within him which can engage the supernatural, which under the breath of the Spirit can come alive and enter into conscious communion with heaven, can receive the divine nature and hear and feel and see the ineffable wonder that is God. When, therefore, an institution dedicated to the growth and development of the thinking person seeks at the same time to turn this thinker into a worshiper, our debt to that institution becomes all the greater. So many schools on every level are content to train the intellect, forgetting that they are dealing with but part of the man-an important part certainly, but a part only. The wise of the world who have not learned to worship are but demi-men, unformed and rudimentary. Their further development awaits the life-giving touch of Christ to wake them to spiritual birth and life eternal.',' Psalm 95:6-7',' Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker; for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care.',' We are made to be worshipers-worshipers of God from the heart.

Not the emotionally ecstatic or feel good-but heart worship of You, my spirit with Your Spirit.'),(680,'The Set of the Sail','16','','44',' The Making of a Man',' But the thinking, worshiping man is still short of perfection until he becomes also the working man. In a world like ours there is and always will be plenty of important work for the thoughtful, reverent man to do. Morally the world is like a bombed city. The streets are blocked, the buildings lie in ruins and the wounded and homeless wait for the healing services of men and women who can help them in their distress. No man can be said to be truly educated who cannot relate his intellectual gifts to creative work. And no work, however sacrificial, will be permanent unless it is geared to eternity. Only what is done in a spirit of worship will last forever. When the man becomes a thinking man a great deal has been accomplished. When the thinking man goes on to become a worshiping man a longer step has been taken toward full and perfect manhood. When the thinking, worshiping man has found his hands and has put his whole personality to work for the high honor of God and the blessing of mankind, some modest approach at least has been made toward Christlikeness and the restoration of the heavenly image ruined in the Fall.',' Colossians 3:23',' Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, . . .',' Doing the work the Lord gives, whether high or low profile, and doing that work with all our heart is a form of worship since we do it for Him and not for those around us.

The great religious thinkers of the past were rarely men of leisure; mostly they were men of affairs, close to and very much a part of the troubled world. Neither will the sanctified thinker of our times be a poet gazing at a sunset from some quiet secluded spot, but one who feels himself a traveler lost in a wilderness who must find his way to safety. That others will later follow the path he makes will not be primary in his thinking. Later he will understand this, but for the time being he will be all engaged hunting the way out for himself. To think well and usefully a man must be endowed with certain indispensable qualifications. He must, for one thing, be completely honest and transparently sincere. The trifler is automatically eliminated. He is weighed in the balance and found too light to be entrusted with the thoughts of God. Let but a breath of levity enter the mind and the power to do creative thinking instantly goes out. And by levity I do not mean wit or even humor; I do mean insincerity, sham, the absence of moral seriousness. Great thoughts require a grave attitude toward life and mankind and God.',' 2 Peter 3:1',' Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.',' Wholesome thinking is not done in a closet or in an isolated ivory tower. Wholesome thinking is serious thinking of depth and breadth done in the midst of busy living in a busy world. It is honest and sincere thinking.',' Father, Im not inclined to wholesome thought. But the intent of Your Word is to stimulate me to wholesome thinking. May I give myself to it!'),(682,'The Set of the Sail','18',' We Need Sanctified Thinkers-2','46',' Chasing Truth',' To think well and usefully a man must be endowed with certain indispensable qualifications. He must, for one thing, be completely honest and transparently sincere. Another qualification is courage. The timid man dare not think lest he discover himself, an experience to him as shocking as the discovery that he has cancer. The sincere thinker comes to his task with the abandonment of a Saul of Tarsus, crying, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Thinking carries a moral imperative. The searcher for truth must be ready to obey truth without reservation or it will elude him. Let him refuse to follow the light and he dooms himself to darkness. The coward may be shrewd or clever but he can never be a wise thinker, for wisdom is at bottom a moral thing and will have no truck with evil. Again, the effective religious thinker must possess some degree of knowledge. A Chinese saying has it, Learning without thought is a snare; thought without learning is a danger. I have met Christians with sharp minds but limited outlook who saw one truth and, being unable to relate it to other truths, became narrow extremists, devoutly cultivating their tiny plot, naively believing that their little fence enclosed the whole earth. An acquaintance with or at least a perception of the significance of what Kant called the starry heavens above and the moral law within is necessary to right thinking. Add to this a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures, a good historic sense and some intimate contact with the Christian religion as it is practiced currently and you have the raw material for creative thought. Still this is not enough to make a thinker.',' Psalm 111:2',' Great are the works of the LORD; they are pondered by all who delight in them.',' Courageous thinking pursued in depth and fixed on God, His Word and our human situation takes us into new territory. It leads to new questions, expanded knowledge and truth new to us. It brings us to our knees in delight before our great God.',' Lord, it is You who have given me the ability to think. May I exercise that ability with courage even though I encounter new problems and questions. May I grow in You.'),(683,'The Set of the Sail','18',' We Need Sanctified Thinkers-2','47',' Worshipful Thinking',' Man is a worshiper and only in the spirit of worship does he find release for all the powers of his amazing intellect. A religious writer has warned us that it may be fatal to trust to the squirrel-work of the industrious brain rather than to the piercing vision of the desirous heart. The Greek church father, Nicephorus, taught that we should learn to think with our heart. Force your mind to descend into the heart, he says, and to remain there. . . . When you thus enter into the place of the heart give thanks to God and, praising His mercy, keep always to this doing, and it will teach you things which in no other way will you ever learn. A religious mentality characterized by timidity and lack of moral courage has given us to a flabby Christianity, intellectually impoverished, dull, repetitious and to a great many persons just plain boring. This is peddled as the very faith of our fathers in direct lineal descent from Christ and the apostles. We spoon-feed this insipid pabulum to our inquiring youth and, to make it palatable, spice it up with carnal amusements filched from the unbelieving world. It is easier to entertain than to instruct, it is easier to follow degenerate public taste than to think for oneself, so too many of our evangelical leaders let their minds atrophy while they keep their fingers nimble operating religious gimmicks to bring in the curious crowds. Christianity must embrace the total personality and command every atom of the redeemed being. We cannot withhold our intellects from the blazing altar and still hope to preserve the true faith of Christ.',' Psalm 64:9',' All mankind will fear; they will proclaim the works of the God and ponder what he has done.',' The indwelling Spirit can inflame our intellect, empowering it to climb new mountains of thought that brings us closer and closer to God.',' Lord, remind me to think from the heart, not just the mind. May I persevere and find answers of heart, if not of mind. Make me a sanctified thinker.'),(684,'The Set of the Sail','19',' Truth is a Great Treasure','48',' Following the Truth',' To know the truth is the greatest privilege any man can enjoy in this life, as truth itself is without doubt the richest treasure anyone can possess. This follows from the nature of truth, and from the world-outlasting dowry it brings to those who open their hearts to it. Apart from truth our human lives would lose all their value, and we ourselves become no better than the beasts that perish. Our response to truth should be eager and instant. We dare not dally with it; we dare not treat it as something we can obey or not obey, at our pleasure. It is a glorious friend, but it is nevertheless a hard master, exacting unquestioning obedience. While a life lived in conformity with the truth will come at last to a good and peaceful end, candor requires us to admit that the lover of truth will have to endure many a heartache, many a sorrow as he journeys through the wilderness. This is the price the world makes him pay for the priceless privilege of obeying the truth. The world being what it is, truth must carry its own forfeit. The servant of truth will be penalized for his devotion. So goes the world always.',' John 14:6',' Jesus answered, I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.',' Christ is the truth. We want to embrace some truth and screen out other truth. We cant. To follow Christ means walking in the truth-all of it!',' It hurts sometimes, Lord, to embrace the truth, all of it. Yet to reject truth is to embrace darkness. You are the truth. Fill all of me!'),(685,'The Set of the Sail','19',' Truth is a Great Treasure','49',' Walking in Truth',' Any man who would escape the heavy tax which humankind lays upon the righteous must make a satisfactory compromise with error. This is so because sin has perverted the nature of things. He that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey is as true now as when it was first uttered. Little as we like to admit it, two thousand years of Christianity have not made much difference. The human race is still cursed with what Bacon called a natural though corrupt love of the lie itself. Nevertheless the hazards of truth should not count in our final tally. Truth is such a royal patron that we should embrace it without regard to cost. The cautious calculator, who tinkers with truth for fear of consequences, is no worthy servant of such a noble master. We Christians above all people should value truth, for we profess to belong to the One who is the Truth. The Stoics who had no access to the Scriptures nevertheless had a noble concept of truth and of mans responsibility to it. When on trial for his life before a hostile and prejudiced court one of them told his accusers: A man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether in doing anything he is doing right or wrong-acting the part of a good man or a bad. The true follower of Christ will not ask, If I embrace this truth, what will it cost me? Rather he will say, This is truth, God help me to walk in it, let come what may!',' Isaiah 30:21',' Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, This is the way; walk in it.',' Some of us want to know the way, the truth just to be knowledgeable among our brothers and sisters. But God shows us truth and says This is the way; walk in it.',' You are the Way, the Truth and the Life. As You show me truth may I walk in the way of it, even though it is sometimes painful.'),(686,'The Set of the Sail','20',' The Blessedness of the Fixed Heart (1/3)','50',' Heart-Matters',' It will probably be found at last that there is no sin except sin of the mind. It is the carnal mind that is enmity against God, that is not subject to the law of God, neither can be. It should, however, be remembered that when the Bible speaks of the mind it does not refer to the intellect alone. The whole personality is included in the concept; the bent of the will, the moral responses, the sympathies and antipathies are there also, as well as the intellect. When God saw the wickedness of man, that it was great in the earth, He saw what could not be seen from the outside, that, as it is rendered in one place, the whole imagination, with the purposes and desires of the heart was only evil continually (Genesis 6:5). From this passage alone we may properly gather that sin has its seat deep within the mind where it pollutes the emotions (desires), the intellect (imaginations) and the will (purposes). These taken together constitute what the Bible and popular theology call the heart.',' Matthew 15:18-19',' But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man unclean. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.',' What we are in heart at times explodes and at other times quietly leaks out through our mouths as well as our gestures, expressions and actions. That is why it is imperative that our hearts be clean and that there Christ be enthroned.',' Examine my heart, Lord, expose it. I want my heart to be Your throne.'),(687,'The Set of the Sail','20',' The Blessedness of the Fixed Heart (2/3)','51',' The Taming of Anger',' It is significant that when our Lord describes the stream of iniquity as it flows out of the heart He begins with the thoughts. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies... Matthew 15:19. It is doubtful whether any sin is ever committed until it first incubates in the thoughts long enough to stir the feelings and predispose the will toward it favorably. Even the sudden flash of anger, which of all sins would appear on the surface to have the lowest mental content, is anything but a sudden eruption of the emotions. The quick-tempered man is one who habitually broods over wrongs and insults and thus conditions himself for the sudden fit of temper that seems to have no mental origin. The heart that has had the benefit of broad, sane thinking on moral questions, especially long meditation upon mans sin, Gods mercy and the goodness of Christ in dying for His enemies, is not conditioned to blow up when occasion arises. The worst reaction to an affront or an injustice will be annoyance or mild irritation, never a burst of sinful anger.',' Ephesians 4:31-32',' Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.',' The short-tempered person is given to fits of rage. Long-temperedness (patience) is part of the fruit of the Spirit as is gentleness and self-control. That fruit is produced in us as we walk by under the Spirits control.',' Lord, help me to relate to people as You do to me-with great patience, grace and gentleness.'),(688,'The Set of the Sail','20',' The Blessedness of the Fixed Heart (3/3)','52',' It Matters What You Think',' It is something of a happy paradox that while the thoughts deeply affect the will and go far to determine its choices, the will on the other hand has the power to control the thoughts. A will firmly engaged with God can swing the intellectual powers around to think on holy things. Were it not so, Pauls words to the Philippians would be psychologically untenable: Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things (Philippians 4:8). Since we are here commanded to think on certain things it follows that we can command our thoughts; and if we can pick the objects upon which to meditate we can in the end sway our whole inner life in the direction of righteousness. It is much more important that we think godly thoughts and will to do Gods will than that we feel spiritual. Religious feelings may and do vary so greatly from person to person, or even in the same person they may vary so widely from one time to the next, that it is never safe to trust them. Let us by a determined act of faith set our affections on things above and God will see to the rest. The safest, and after a while the happiest, man is the one who can say, My heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.',' Philippians 4:8',' Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-if anything is excellent or praiseworthy-think about such things.',' Thoughts invade our thinking because of the world around us and things stored in our subconscious. We cant altogether prevent thought invasion. But when wrong thoughts, evil thoughts arise we can deliberately focus our mind on things good.',' Lord, I determine by Your enablement to think about the good.'),(689,'The Set of the Sail','21',' How the Lord Leads (1/4)','53',' On Knowing the Will of God',' One of the problems most frequently encountered by serious-minded Christians is how to discover the will of God in a given situation. This is not a small matter. To countless thousands of Christians it is vitally important. Their peace of heart depends upon knowing that God is actually guiding them, and their failure to be sure that He is destroys their inward tranquility and fills them with uncertainty and fear. They must get help if they are to regain their confidence. Here is a modest effort to provide some help. First, it is absolutely essential that we be completely dedicated to Gods high honor and surrendered to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. God will not lead us except for His own glory and He cannot lead us if we resist His will. The shepherd cannot lead a stubborn sheep. The evil practice of using God must be abandoned. Instead of trying to employ God to achieve our ends we must submit ourselves joyously to God and let Him work through us to achieve His own ends.',' Matthew 26:39',' Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.',' Have you ever tried to use God? Have you attempted to persuade Him to do your will rather than you doing His? To know His will we must be fully committed to do it!',' Lord, You were fully committed to do the will of the Father, costly as it was. By Your Spirit strengthen within me the resolve to do Your will no matter the cost.'),(690,'The Set of the Sail','21',' How the Lord Leads (2/4)','54',' The Choice Quandary',' One of the problems most frequently encountered by serious-minded Christians is how to discover the will of God in a given situation. Now, granted that we are wholly committed to God with every full intent to obey Him, we may expect actually to be led by Him. The Scriptures that teach this are so many that one scarcely knows where to begin quoting. It only remains for us to believe they mean what they say. The many choices that we Christians must make from to involve only four kinds of things: Those concerning which God has said an emphatic no; those about which He has said an equally emphatic yes; those concerning which He wants us to consult our own sanctified preferences; and those few and rare matters about which we cannot acquire enough information to permit us to make intelligent decisions and which for that reason require some special guidance from the Lord to prevent us from making serious mistakes. Regardless of what our positive thinkers have said, the Scriptures have much to say about things Christians are not to do. Every call to repentance is a call to negative as well as to positive moral action. Cease to do evil; learn to do well is a fair epitome of the moral teaching of the Bible.',' Isaiah 1:16-17',' . . . Stop doing wrong, learn to do right! . . .',' Determining the Lords will can be difficult at times. The problem may be that we are not sufficiently familiar with His Word so as to know what He specifically forbids or positively commands. Such knowledge can often reduce the choice quandary.',' Lord, forgive me for sometimes refusing to see what You have clearly revealed in Your Word. Your way is the only way.'),(691,'The Set of the Sail','21',' How the Lord Leads (3/4)','55',' Steering by Gods Compass',' Put this down as an unfailing rule: Never seek the leading of the Lord concerning an act that is forbidden in the Word of God. To do so is to convict ourselves of insincerity. Again, prophet, psalmist, apostle and our blessed Lord Himself join to point out the way of positive obedience. His yoke is easy, His burden is light and He giveth more grace, so let this be the second rule: Never seek the leading of the Lord concerning an act that has been commanded in the Scriptures. Now, a happy truth too often overlooked in our anxious search for the will of God is that in the majority of decisions touching our earthly lives God expresses no choice, but leaves everything to our own preference. Some Christians walk under a cloud of uncertainty, worrying about which profession they should enter, which car they should drive, which school they should attend, where they should live and a dozen or score of other such matters, when their Lord has set them free to follow their own personal bent, guided only by their love for Him and for their fellow men. On the surface it appears more spiritual to seek Gods leading than just to go ahead and do the obvious thing. But it is not. If God gave you a watch would you honor Him more by asking Him for the time of or by consulting the watch? If God gave a sailor a compass would the sailor please God more by kneeling in a frenzy of prayer to persuade God to show him which way to go or by steering according to the compass?',' Philippians 2:13',' for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.',' Sometimes God shouts to us through our circumstances. His will seems too obvious. But a study of Pauls life shows that God leads us in different ways at different times in our pilgrimage.',' Father, at times I have in effect demanded revelation of Your will to me in life hurricanes and earthquakes. May I discern it as well in the unspectacular circumstances of life-the quiet compass You have given me.'),(692,'The Set of the Sail','21',' How the Lord Leads (4/4)','56',' He Leadeth Me',' Except for those things that are specifically commanded or forbidden, it is God\'s will that we be free to exercise our own intelligent choice. The shepherd will lead the sheep but he does not wish to decide which tuft of grass the sheep shall nibble each moment of the day. In almost everything touching our common life on earth God is pleased when we are pleased. He wills that we be as free as birds to soar and sing our Maker\'s praise without anxiety. God\'s choice for us may not be one but any one of a score of possible choices. The man or woman who is wholly and joyously surrendered to Christ cannot make a wrong choice. Any choice will be the right one. But what about those rare times when a great deal is at stake, we can discover no clear scriptural instruction and yet are forced to choose between two possible courses? In such a situation we have God\'s faithful promise to guide us aright. Here, for instance, are two passages from the Word of the Lord: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering (James 1:5,6). Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go (Isaiah 48:17). Take your problem to the Lord. Remind Him of these promises. Then get up and do what looks best to you. Either choice will be right. God will not permit you to make a mistake.',' Isaiah 48:17',' . . . I am the LORD your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go.',' Sometimes God leads us through scripture. At other times it is direction by His Spirit internally. There are occasions, too, when He leads through other people whom we respect and admire. Or it may be just circumstances. What matters is assurance of hear',' O Lord, may I be increasingly sensitive to You to discern Your will in whatsoever way You show it to me. In Jesus name.'),(693,'The Set of the Sail','22',' Our Business is God (1/3)','57',' Being Church',' If we could bring together in one huge directory a list of all the organizations, great and small, that exist throughout the earth for the promotion of special interests we would be astounded at the number of them. Almost everything that human beings do or can do has its organization, association, society or guild to focus attention upon it and promote its ends. Some of these are good, some are bad, most of them are just neutral; but each one, however boring or comical it may appear to those who are not interested, has its starry-eyed devotees who live for it alone and who derive their keenest pleasure from their preoccupation with it. In the midst of all this there is one group of persons whose absorbing interest is, or should be, God. That group is the Church. The Church is born out of the gospel and that gospel has to do with God and mans relation to God. Christianity engages to bring God into human life, to make men right with God, to give them a heart knowledge of God, to teach them to love and obey God and ultimately to restore in them the lost image of God in full and everlasting perfection.',' First Corinthians 1:2',' To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ-their Lord and ours.',' The Church is the people of God, the family of God. Wherever the people of God are the Church is. We are members of Christs body in the world. We are not confined to a church building. We are the Church wherever we are.',' O Lord, may Your Church be the Church-bold and unashamed. We are Your people through whom You seek to reach those around us.'),(694,'The Set of the Sail','22',' Our Business is God (2/3)','58',' Knowing God',' Our Lord, in defining eternal life, summed up the supreme goal of human existence: That they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. And Paul revealed the one overpowering interest of his life when he wrote That I may know him. The business of the Church is God. She is purest when most engaged with God and she is astray just so far as she follows other interests, no matter how religious or humanitarian they may be. There are a thousand useful, even noble, pursuits in which the Church may engage and which may bring her the plaudits of the world but which are nevertheless unworthy of her utter devotion. Such are social activities for their own sake, philosophical pursuits divorced from Him in whom all wisdom and knowledge is hidden away, art, music, education, travel, to name a mere few. As these things come to the Christian in his pursuit of God they may have a proper and useful place in his life; but when they are chosen as ends to be followed they are and can only be cheap substitutes for the glory that excelleth.',' John 17:3',' Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.',' Eternal life is experientially knowing God. It is why we were created. Eternal life is not just an unending quantity of life. It is supernatural quality of life.',' That I may know You, O God, that I may know You. That is eternal life!'),(695,'The Set of the Sail','22',' Our Business is God (3/3)','59',' Misunderstood Salt',' For choosing God as our one all absorbing interest we Christians are sometimes scorned or written off as hopelessly narrow-minded. But must we apologize? Must we apologize that we have chosen Christ as our career? That we deliberately will to walk with those who walk with God? That we have chosen eternity over time and heaven over earth? Must we apologize that we have chosen to seek good and not evil all the days of our lives? That we have chosen so to live that we dare to die? In so choosing whom have we injured? Whose son or daughter is the worse for knowing us? Whose house have we robbed or whose money have we stolen? Whom have we led into crime? Who is a worse husband or father or citizen for following our Savior? If we have wronged anyone it is in spite of our Christian faith, not because of it. No man, no home, no nation is the worse for the presence of a real Christian. Gerhard Tersteegen, the saintly silk weaver, said it for us in a delightful little bit of verse: Child of the Eternal Father, Bride of the Eternal Son, Dwelling place of God the Spirit, Thus with Christ made ever one; Dowered with joy beyond the angels, Nearest to His throne, They the ministers attending His beloved one: Granted all my hearts desire, All things made my own; Feared by all the powers of evil, Fearing God alone; Walking with the Lord in glory Through the courts divine, Queen within the royal palace, Christ forever mine: Say, poor worldling, can it be That my heart should envy thee?',' Matthew 5:13',' You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.',' We are to be salt and salt is not always appreciated. We are to be light and those around may resent the light because they love darkness.',' Lord, may I be salt and light in this world. Shine through me though I be only a flickering candle.'),(696,'The Set of the Sail','23',' We Must Depend upon the Holy Spirit (1/4)','60',' The Rigors of Shepherding',' Because we are the kind of persons we are and because we live in a world such as we do, the shepherd of souls is often forced to work at what would appear to be cross purposes with himself. For instance, he must encourage the timid and warn the self-confident; and these may at any given time be present in his congregation in almost equal numbers. His effort to encourage those who need encouragement may actually confirm presumptuous souls in their carelessness. Conversely, his much needed warnings and reproofs may drive timorous and doubting Christians to the borders of despair. Another problem he faces is the presence in the normal Christian assembly of believers in every stage of development, from the newly converted who knows almost nothing about the Christian life to the wise and experienced Christian who seems to know almost everything.',' John 21:16',' Again Jesus said, Simon son of John, do you truly love me? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you. Jesus said, Take care of my sheep.',' Taking care of a flock of sheep is a demanding task particularly if that flock includes sheep like you and me! Are you praying for your pastor/shepherd?',' You are the Great Shepherd, the Good Shepherd. Thank You for Your undershepherds who have faithfully shepherded me over the years.'),(697,'The Set of the Sail','23',' We Must Depend upon the Holy Spirit (2/4)','61',' Preaching the Word',' Again, the Christian minister must have a word from God for the teen-aged, the middle-aged and the very aged. He must speak to the scholar as well as to the ignorant; he must bring the living Word to the cultured man and woman and to the vulgarian who reads nothing but the sports page and the comic strip. He must speak to the sad and to the happy, to the tender-minded and to the tough-minded, to those eager to live and to some who secretly wish they could die. And he must do this all in one sermon and in a period of time not exceeding 45 minutes. Surely this requires a Daniel, and Daniels are as scarce in the United States as in Babylon in 600 B.C. To add to the pastors burden is the knowledge that in each service there will likely be a few lost sons who should come home, some who never loved God at all and some who lost the love they had. So he must call sinners to repentance, warn the unruly, comfort the feebleminded, instruct, reprove, rebuke, encourage, console and exhort all at the same time, or at least on the same day. This is the situation stated baldly, but it is not actually as difficult as it looks. I said that the preacher appears to be at cross purposes with himself; but it is in appearance only, for what seems to be confusion is but the seamy side of the tapestry. The artistic pattern is on the other side.',' Second Timothy 4:2',' Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage-with great patience and careful instruction.',' Were you fed last Sunday? You may have been entertained, amused even encouraged. Were you fed? Was the Word preached?',' Father, may our pastors preach the Word-exegeting, interpreting and applying accurately that truth they have prayerfully received from You.'),(698,'The Set of the Sail','23',' We Must Depend upon the Holy Spirit (3/4)','62',' All People are . . . People!',' The man of God may labor on in complete trust and in full expectation of success, provided he is aware of a few basic truths. One is that however different people may be in externals, they are all alike fundamentally. That in us to which the Christian message is directed is the same in every human being. Before the cross of Jesus we are not old or young, educated or ignorant, cultured or uncouth, dull or brilliant; we are just people-human beings lost and ruined deep inside where incidental differences do not matter, where indeed they are not even known. As gold is gold whether it is mixed with the sand of the stream or wrought into an exquisite work of art by the hand of a Cellini, so the essential stuff of human nature is the same under whatever conditions it may be found. That about us which yields itself to social differentiation, is not that for which Christ died. He did not, for example, die for doctors, farmers, authors, laborers, artists, engineers, professors, vagrants, presidents, musicians, lumbermen; He died for lost humanity, and any one can receive the benefits of His atonement, but only as lost beings. Color, race, social standings, occupation, cultural levels do not count, for they do not alter the basic human thing for which His blood was shed.',' John 3:16',' God loved the people of this world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who has faith in him will have eternal life and never really die (Contemporary English Version).',' Whoever we are in the world our most basic need is to know Christ as our Savior and Lord. In dependence upon the Holy Spirit that Good News must be communicated in a linguistically and culturally perceptible form to each one of the worlds billions.',' O Lord, people need You-those people around me and around the world. Use me to reach some of them. In Jesus name.'),(699,'The Set of the Sail','23',' We Must Depend upon the Holy Spirit (4/4)','63',' The Brooding Spirit of God',' Because the inner lostness is the same in all human beings the work of God to reclaim them must be the same in all. And the Spirit broods over all, illuminating, revealing, convicting, enabling them to hear and see and understand. It is one of the wonders and delights of preaching that the same message will often affect people differently, producing in one repentance, in another hope, in still others courage, humility or faith, according as the particular soul has need. Without this mighty, skillful working of the Spirit, preaching would be futile; with it the ministry of the Word can be easy and delightful as well as marvelously effective.',' Acts 16:14',' One of the those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Pauls message.',' It is the Holy Spirit who opens hearts to respond to the Good News. It is the Spirit who illuminates the Word. It is the Spirit who reveals Christ and convicts of sin. We minister in vain without the Spirits ministry!',' Thank You, Lord, that You do not hold me responsible to open the hearts of people.

The cult of relaxation has, in fact, quite taken over certain areas of the religious thinking of the day. Of course the fear-not cultists are able to assemble a lot of Scripture to support their teaching, but the catch is that practically all of it is misunderstood or misapplied. It just doesnt mean what they say it does, and what is still worse, it isnt addressed to the people they try to apply it to. The fear-not philosophers all begin with the same error; namely, that there is nothing to fear, and all we need to do to get deliverance is to believe it. To teach people living in a world like ours that there is nothing to be afraid of is to be guilty of gross irresponsibility, and any teacher who does so disqualifies himself instantly and proves himself unworthy of the confidence of serious-minded men. Both the Bible and human experience teach that the world is full of enemies to mankind, not the least of those dangers being man himself. Our Lord said, I will forewarn you whom you shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into Hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.',' Hebrews 10:31',' It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.',' How terrible to be lulled into false peace by those who peddle untruth.

The consequences of his sins, death, judgment and hell are all awaiting him and he cannot escape them by looking the other way. While he lives on earth there are dangers of every kind facing him and everyone he loves. Any religious teacher that exhorts him to ignore these dangers is unrealistic, false to the facts and a deadly enemy to his soul. The prophet of tranquility is indeed another source of danger to him and should be considered one more object of fear. Where there are mortal perils and no place to hide, fear is the only sane reaction. To dismiss fear while the danger still exists is little short of insanity. Until the danger has been removed, fear should remain. Only that man has a right to be unafraid who has fled for refuge to the mighty Savior. Such a man knows the danger is there, but he also knows that his Almighty Lord will bring him safely through and present him at last faultless before the presence of God. There are in the Scriptures innumerable exhortations to put away fear; but they are all addressed to Gods own children, never to the children of this world. Someone must care, and if a man has not cast his fears on Christ, he must bear them himself. The safety of the Rock is for those who have put their trust in the Rock. All others must face their enemies alone.',' Romans 8:1-2',' Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.',' There is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.

When he believes effectively on Christ as his Lord and Savior he can humbly declare his independence of everyone and everything outside of Christ. This the New Testament teaches with great emphasis and clarity and with fullness of detail. We need not quote any proof text in support of this statement, but suggest simply that the inquirer read the Scriptures to see for himself, especially John, Ephesians, Colossians and Hebrews. One marked characteristic of modern evangelicalism is its lack of assurance, resulting in a pathetic search for external evidence to corroborate its faith. It sets out bravely to declare its trust in Christ, but is shortly overawed by the counter declarations of science and philosophy and before long it is looking hesitantly about for some collateral evidence to restore its confidence.',' Ephesians 1:3',' Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.',' Blessed in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ what more do we need?

It is a tragicomic sight to see our modern apostles licking the palm of any man of learning who will condescend to say something complimentary about Jesus Christ. How eagerly we rush into print with any quotation from the lips of the Great Man of the world that can be tortured into an admission that he believes that Jesus is the Son of God. The New Testament points to Christ and says God now commands all men everywhere to repent: because He has appointed a day, in which He will judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom He has ordained; whereof He has given assurance unto all men, in that He has raised Him from the dead. God validated forever the claims of Christ. He is who He said He was and what He said He was. Christ stands before no man to be judged, but every man stands before Him. Any uncertainty about Him was swept away forever when He arose from the dead, ascended into heaven and sent down the Holy Spirit as His final witness among men. Now it may be said that Christ as the Second person of the Godhead is self-validating. He needs no supplementary witness from the world of nature or from the race of men. He is His own witness.',' Psalm 89:15',' Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence, O LORD.',' Transformation of life and continued communion with God is sufficient validation that He is all that scripture reveals Him to be. What matters is not what others affirm or deny concerning Christ but who we have personally found and are finding Him to be.',' Knowing You, Lord, and experiencing Your presence is the greatest affirmation for me that You are God.'),(704,'The Set of the Sail','25',' Christ Is All We Need (3/3)','68',' Christ: Our Only Grounds for Boasting',' The faith of the Christian rests upon Christ Himself. On Him we repose and in Him we live. Christ gains nothing from any human philosophy, however pure and noble it may be. He owes nothing to Plato or to Aristotle. If these men had never lived the Christ in whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily would have been all He ever was and is world without end. His redemptive work was completed centuries before the dawn of modern science, and of course seeks no aid from science. Christ is unique in the only sense that word will bear. He is the mystery of Godliness, a miracle, an emergence of the Deity into time and space for a reason and a purpose. He is complete in Himself. Because we Christians live on two life-levels simultaneously, the spiritual and the natural, we do, as sons of Adam, owe to philosophy and science a lasting debt of gratitude. Music, literature, art, state-craft, economics, learning contribute to our welfare and make the world a more comfortable place in which to live while we wait for the manifestation of the sons of God and the redemption of our bodies. So it is good that we gain all the knowledge we can in the short time that is ours. Whatever we learn that is true will remain our treasured possession in the world to come. For these reasons I believe in education, as full as possible for as many as possible as quickly as possible. That is one thing. It is quite another to try to equate the faith of Christ with Philosophy or science or any other or all of the products of superior human minds. And to make that faith dependent upon these things is in the light of Christs deity not only preposterous but near to sacrilegious. Christ is enough. To have Him and nothing else is to be rich beyond conceiving. To have all else and have not Christ is to be a cosmic pauper, cut off forever from all that will matter at last.',' First Corinthians 1:30-31',' It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God-that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. Therefore, as it is written: Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.',' Wisdom, righteousness, holiness and redemption-Christ is all! Its time that we enjoyed our spiritual wealth in Him and left spiritual poverty behind.',' O Christ, everything is in You and You are everything!'),(705,'The Set of the Sail','26',' We Need to Elevate Our Sights (1/2)','69',' Are We Missing the Churchs Purpose?',' It would be too easy to dismiss this dislike for church as only another symptom of original sin and love of moral darkness, but I believe that explanation is too pat to be wholly true. It doesnt explain enough. Some persons, for instance, find church intolerable because there is no objective toward which pastor and people are moving, aside possibly from the limited one of trying to enlist eight more women and 10 more men to chaperon the annual youth cookout or reaching the building fund quota for the month. And believe me, that can get mighty wearisome after a while, so wearisome indeed that alert, forward-looking persons often forsake the churches in droves and leave the spiritless, the dull and those afflicted with permanent insouciance to carry on, if a phrase so active dare be used to describe what they do. To Paul there was nothing dull or tiresome in the religion of Christ. God had a plan which was being carried forward to completion, and Paul and all the faithful in Christ Jesus were part of that plan. It included predestination, redemption, adoption and the obtaining of an eternal inheritance in the heavenly places. Gods purpose has now been openly revealed (Ephesians 3:10,11). It was the knowledge that they were part of an eternal plan that imparted unquenchable enthusiasm to the early Christians. They burned with holy zeal for Christ and felt that they were part of an army which the Lord was leading to ultimate conquest over all the powers of darkness. That was enough to fill them with perpetual enthusiasm.',' Ephesians 3:10-11',' His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.',' Gods eternal purpose is that His manifold wisdom be made known through the Church. Is that the purpose statement of your church? Lets find out what God means and adopt His purpose for us.',' Lord, give me greater understanding of what You are about in this world that our local church may be CHURCH as You intend.'),(706,'The Set of the Sail','26',' We Need to Elevate Our Sights (2/2)','70',' Prosperous, Comfortable and Spiritually Bored',' The evangelical Christian need make no apology for his beliefs. They are in direct lineal descent from those of the apostles. He can check the tenets of his total creed against the life giving, transforming beliefs of church fathers both East and West, reformers, mystics, missionaries, saints and evangelists, and they will check out one by one. Then let him check them all with the Holy Scriptures and again they will prove to be sound. What then is the trouble? Why the inertia, the torpor that lies over the church? The answer is that we are too comfortable, too rich, too contented. We hold the faith of our fathers, but it does not hold us. We are suffering from judicial blindness visited upon us because of our sins. To us has been committed the most precious of all treasures, but we are not committed to it. We insist upon making our religion a form of amusement and will have fun whether or not. We are afflicted with religious myopia and see only things near at hand. God has set eternity in our hearts and we have chosen time instead. He is trying to interest us in a glorious tomorrow and we are settling for an inglorious today. We are bogged down in local interests and have lost sight of eternal purposes. We improvise and muddle along, hoping for heaven at last but showing no eagerness to get there, correct in doctrine but weary of prayer and bored with God.',' Ephesians 3:17-19',' . . .And I pray that you . . . may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.',' Paul prays that the Ephesian believers may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. To the measure of all the fullness of God! Why are we satisfied with infinitely less?',' Forgive me, Lord, for the pursuit of the good things to the neglect of You the source of real goodness and heart satisfaction.'),(707,'The Set of the Sail','27',' The Sovereignty of Truth-1 (1/2)','71',' The Good Life that Turns Out to be Not So Good',' Almost everywhere it is assumed that people are seeking truth, that society is literally swarming with dedicated truth seekers. The fact is that men have never in any numbers sought after truth. If we may judge peoples interests by their deeds, then of the young men and women who stream forth from our halls of learning each year the vast majority have no more than a passing and academic interest in truth. They go to college not to satisfy a yearning to discover truth, but to improve their social standing and increase their earning power. These motives are not necessarily to be despised; but they should be known for what they are, and not hidden beneath a pink cloud of specious idealism. What are people actually seeking? Of course they seek satisfaction for the basic urges such as hunger, sex and social companionship; but beyond these what? Certainly for nothing as high and noble as truth. Ask the average American what he wants from life and if he is candid he will tell you he wants success in his chosen field; and he wants success both for the prestige it brings him and for the financial security it affords. And why does he want financial security? To guarantee him against the loss of comforts, luxuries and pleasures, which he believes are rightfully his as a part of his American heritage. The ominous thing about all this is that everything he wants can be bought with money. It would be hard to think of an indictment more terrible than that.',' Luke 12:19-20',' And Ill say to myself, You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry. But God said to him, You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourse',' For the rich man wealth insured his future. But what a very limited future it proved to be. Financial security is of no worth beyond death. After death what counts is having found truth and obeyed it.',' Father, I know that money cannot buy eternal truth. Deliver me from living as if it could.'),(708,'The Set of the Sail','27',' The Sovereignty of Truth-1 (2/2)','72',' Where Truth Leads Us',' The world is full of seekers, true enough, and they gravitate quite naturally toward the church. Seekers after peace of mind are plentiful enough to keep the printing presses busy; seekers after physical health are always with us in sufficient numbers to make our leading faith healers comfortably rich; seekers after success and safety are legion, as our popular religious leaders know too well. But real seekers after truth are almost as rare as albino deer. And here is why: Truth is a glorious but hard master. It makes moral demands upon us. It claims the sovereign right to control us, to strip us, even to slay us as it chooses. Truth will never stoop to be a servant but requires that all men serve it. It never flatters men and never compromises with them. It demands all or nothing and refuses to be used or patronized. It will be all in all or it will withdraw into silence. It was Christ who capitalized truth and revealed that it was not an it at all but a Being with all the attributes of personality. I am the Truth, He said, and followed truth straight to the cross. The truth seeker must follow Him there; and that is the reason few men seek truth.',' Romans 8:5-6','Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace;',' Seeing truth means following Christ who is the Truth. Inevitably Christ leads us to the cross, our cross-saying no to the sinful nature so as to live in accordance with the indwelling Spirit.',' Lord, saying no to desires of the sinful nature seems to close the door on so many self-pleasing pleasures. Yet it opens to me the Spirit-controlled life, living the truth.'),(709,'The Set of the Sail','28',' The Sovereignty of Truth-2 (1/3)','73',' To Be Discovered, Truth Must Be Obeyed',' It is born in every man to want to dramatize his life and to cast himself as the star of the performance . Once let a man become persuaded that he is a hero in quest of the holy grail of truth and he becomes a victim of a pretty and pleasant delusion that inflates his ego and blinds him to the very truth he claims to seek. And if he is later forced to admit that he has not found it he absolves himself from all guilt, for has he not searched? Has he not hunted through the years for the precious treasure? Where is the stone he has left unturned? Where has he not drilled or digged among the philosophies and religions of the world? Why then has he not found? To him there can be only one answer: The Spirit and Wisdom of the universe has let him down. The great Oversoul has withheld the secret from him. So he tells himself and in wounded dignity walks stiffly into the sunset convinced that he has been deeply wronged in his effort to discover lifes summum bonum. His is a tragedy worthy of Aeschylus and he himself grand in failure and noble in defeat. Disillusioning people is a thankless task and quite plainly does not come under the category of making friends and thinking positively. Nevertheless it must be done if we are to rescue lost men from the consequences of their delusions. So let me say boldly that it is not the difficulty of discovering truth but the unwillingness to obey it that makes it so rare among men.',' John 8:31-32',' To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.',' Often it is the simple, marginally educated people who find ultimate truth while the intelligentsia search in vain. The reason is that truth to be discovered must be obeyed.',' Thank You, Father, for the example of common but godly people whose lives have demonstrated to me that the simplest may find the truth if they are but willing to obey it.'),(710,'The Set of the Sail','28',' The Sovereignty of Truth-2 (2/3)','74',' Truth that Seeks Lost People',' Our Lord said, I am the Truth, and again He said, The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Truth therefore is not hard to find for the very reason that it is seeking us. Truth is not a thing for which we must search, but a Person to whom we must hearken. This is taught or taken for granted in the record of Gods dealings with men throughout the Sacred Scriptures. After the sin in Eden it was not Adam who cried O God, where art Thou? but God who cried Where art thou? as He sought for Adam among the trees of the Garden. Abraham heard God speak and responded, but it was God who was the aggressor. God appeared unto Jacob before Jacob came to appear before God. And in the burning bush God revealed Himself to Moses. Again and again did God take the initiative. He sought for Gideon and found him on the threshing floor of Ophrah. He showed Himself to Isaiah when there is no evidence that Isaiah was seeking Him. Before Jeremiah was born God laid His hand upon him, and He opened heaven to let the discouraged priest Ezekiel see a vision and hear a voice. Amos said he was not a prophet neither a prophets son, but the Lord took him as he followed the flock. Again God was the aggressor. In the New Testament things are not otherwise. True, multitudes came to Christ for physical help, but only rarely did one seek Him out to learn the truth; and even that rare one usually turned away when the truth was told him. The whole picture in the Gospels is one of a seeking Savior, not one of seeking men. The truth was hunting for those who would receive it, and relatively few did. Many are called, but few are chosen.',' Luke 19:10',' For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.',' Christ is the Truth. He is also the seeker of lost people. Long before we ever sought truth, Truth was seeking us.',' Before I ever reached out to You, You were reaching out to me. All praise to You, Im found!'),(711,'The Set of the Sail','28',' The Sovereignty of Truth-2 (3/3)','75',' The Cause of Continued Darkness',' The truth in the Person of the Logos, the Word, is seeking to illuminate the minds of men. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. For this reason, when we conceive ourselves to be honest seekers who cannot find the light we are in a state of dangerous self-deception. It is a grave situation. Unless help comes quickly the darkness may close down upon us permanently. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness. Behind all our failure to find light is an unconfessed and possibly an unconscious love of darkness. This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God (John 3:19-21). We should always remember that we are accountable not only for the light we have but also for the light we might have if we were willing to obey it. Truth is sovereign and will not allow itself to be trifled with. And it is easy to find for it is trying to find us. Obedience is the big problem: and unwillingness to obey is the cause of continued darkness.',' John 3:19',' This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.',' Are we going through life with our eyes closed to the light because we love darkness? Rise up to obey the Light and more light will flood into our lives. We have been reborn to walk in light.',' Shine, Jesus, shine in this heart of mine. Expose those pockets of darkness. I want to live in the sunlight of Your love.'),(712,'The Set of the Sail','29',' What About the Ethics of Jesus? (1/3)','76',' Selective Acceptance of the Teaching of Christ and the Apostles',' It may seem a bit odd that the religious teachers who exalted the teachings of Jesus to the seventh empyrean should in the same breath demote the person of Jesus to the level of a common man; yet they did just that. They lamented with many a crocodile tear the error of the Church in worshiping Jesus and failing to spread His ethics throughout the earth. The implication was that the man Jesus was important only because of the sterling quality of His ethics; though it was hard for some then and it is hard for others now to understand how a mans teaching can be greater than the man. The same persons who exalted His doctrine of love completely ignored His claim to deity and brushed aside His teachings on sin, judgment and hell, as well as His whole system of eschatology. This arrogant picking and choosing among the words of Christ gave some persons the impression that these teachers were far less sincere than they claimed to be, for a man need not be a genius to reach the conclusion that if Jesus was wrong about almost all of His teachings there could be no certainty that He was right about the rest. Well, it is not my intention to fight again the battle of Bunker Hill. If all this belonged only to the past we might be content to let the dead bury their dead and pass on to something else; but the ghosts of the old Modernists appear to have been reincarnated and many of the arguments raised by the liberals a generation ago are now being repeated by the orthodox.',' Acts 2:42',' They devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.',' It seems that in each generation certain biblical teaching is debated as to the authors intent, meaning, cultural context and whether locally or universally applicable. Current issues include homosexual practice and the nature of family. Do disciples hav',' Lord, keep me from error in understanding Your Word and the response You desire from me to it. In Jesus name.'),(713,'The Set of the Sail','29',' What About the Ethics of Jesus? (2/3)','77',' Living Christs Ethics Requires His Power',' The ethics of Jesus must be imposed upon society, we are told, then all inequalities will vanish; the division of humanity into rich and poor, great and small, privileged and underprivileged will be no more. Under the benign influence of Christs ethics of love, greed and war will disappear from the earth and the dream of universal brotherhood be realized at last. The teachings of Jesus belong to the Church, not to society. In society is sin and sin is hostility to God. Christ did not teach that He would impose His teachings upon the fallen world. He called His disciples to Him and taught them, and everywhere throughout His teachings there is the overt or implied idea that His followers will constitute an unpopular minority group in an actively hostile world. The divine procedure is to go into the world of fallen men, preach to them the necessity to repent and become disciples of Christ and, after making disciples, to teach them the ethics of Jesus, which Christ called all things whatsoever I have commanded you. The ethics of Jesus cannot be obeyed or even understood until the life of God has come to the heart of a man in the miracle of the new birth. The righteousness of the law is fulfilled in them who walk in the Spirit. Christ lives again in His redeemed follower the life He lived in Judea; for righteousness can never be divorced from its source, which is Jesus Christ Himself.',' Matthew 28:19-20',' Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them . . . and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. . . .',' We all discover that we cant practice the ethics of Jesus without His enablement. He makes that enablement available to us by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.',' O Christ, I am breathing out my own life, that I may be filled with Thine; letting go my strength and weakness, breathing in Thy life divine.'),(714,'The Set of the Sail','29',' What About the Ethics of Jesus? (3/3)','78',' Universal Brotherhood: The Impossible Dream',' The dream of a universal brotherhood based upon the ethics of Jesus is just that-a dream. It is compounded of a few words of Christ mixed with vast numbers of uninspired words spoken by men whose yearnings are to be commended but whose wisdom is suspect. To arrive at the doctrine of brotherhood it is necessary that we reject the major portion of the New Testament and misunderstand the rest. There were once two brothers. They lived in a society that had not had time to develop the many social evils we know today. Yet one killed the other because sin was there. If two brothers in the morning of the world could not get on together, how can we hope that the gentle teachings of Jesus can ever bring brotherhood to a race filled with complex iniquities, where men inherit hates and where the souls of all are lacerated by jealousy, envy, egotism, greed and lust? The hope of the individual is the new birth and the acceptance of the teachings of Christ as a way of life. The hope of the race is that Christ shall come again to earth. Even so, Lord, come quickly.',' Matthew 22:37-39',' Jesus replied: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all you soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.',' Can men and women obey the Great Commandments without submitting themselves to the Great Commander? Lets not be shocked when unbelievers fail to live by the Great Commandments. But what is our excuse for not doing so?',' Forgive me, Lord, for expecting of others Christlike living when they have never been born of You.

Even a single phrase may glow with a light like that of the ancient pillar of fire and its shining may illuminate the intellectual landscape for miles around. An example is found in Jeremiah 10:23. After the Lord had spoken of the vanity of idols and had set in contrast to the gods of the heathen the glory of the living God, the King of Eternity, the prophet responded in an inspired exclamation that very well states the whole problem of humankind: O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. The prophet here turns to a figure of speech, one which appears in the Scriptures so frequently that it is not easy to remember that it is but a figure. Man is seen as a traveler making his difficult way from a past he can but imperfectly recollect into a future about which he knows nothing. And he cannot stay, but must each morning strike his moving tent and journey on toward-and there is the heavy problem-toward what?',' Jeremiah 10:23',' I know, O LORD, that a mans life is not his own; it is not for man to direct his steps.',' It is not for us to direct our steps but how often we try. Only God knows the way ahead. The Good Shepherd leads if we will but follow.',' It is for You to direct my steps. Today, Good Shepherd, lead me and I will follow.'),(716,'The Set of the Sail','30',' We Have Lost Our Way (2/4)','80',' Do You Know Where You are Going?',' It is a simple axiom of the traveler that if he would arrive at the desired destination he must take the right road. How far a man may have traveled is not important; what matters is whether or not he is going the right way, whether the path he is following will bring him out at the right place at last. Sometimes there will be an end to the road, and maybe sooner than he knows; but when he has gone the last step of the way will he find himself in a tomorrow of light and peace, or will the toward which he journeys be a of trouble and distress, a of wasteness and desolation, a of darkness and gloominess, a of clouds and thick darkness? The inspired prophet Jeremiah says (and for that matter all the holy prophets who have spoken since the world began say) and our Lord and His apostles say that man does not know the way; indeed he hardly knows where he should go, to say nothing of the way he should take to get there. The worried Thomas spoke for every man when he asked, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? That is the truth and we had better face it squarely: the way of man is not in himself. However severe the blow to our pride, we would do well to bow our heads and admit our ignorance. For those who know not and know they know not, there may in the mercy of God be hope; for those who think they know there can be only increasing darkness.',' John 14:5',' Thomas said to him, Lord, we dont know where you are going, so how can we know the way?',' We think we know the road we are traveling and then in a moment everything comes crashing down around us-sorrow, sickness, disappointment, failure. Our hearts cry out: We dont know the way! Then we sense the quiet voice of Jesus: I am the Way, follow me.',' All the way You lead me, Lord. You are the Way. I have only to follow whether in the bright sunshine or the clouds of darkness.'),(717,'The Set of the Sail','30',' We Have Lost Our Way (3/4)','81',' Hopelessly Lost',' Philosophically man has lost his way. Could he think himself out of his age-old predicament he would long ago have done it, for the world has had more than enough serious-minded men of superior intellectual endowments to examine every rabbit path in all the meadows of human thought and to explore every forest and wilderness in search of the way. Since the first fallen man got still long enough to think, fallen men have been asking these questions, Whence came I? What am I? Why am I here? and Where am I going? The noblest minds of the race have struggled with these questions to no avail. Did the answer lie somewhere hidden like a jewel it would surely have been uncovered, for the most penetrating minds of the race have searched for it. Not a foot of ground but has been spaded up, neither is there crevice or cave anywhere in the region of human experience but has been spied into thoroughly and often as the centuries passed. Yet the answers remain as securely hidden as if they did not exist. Why is man lost philosophically? Because he is lost morally and spiritually. He cannot answer the questions life presents to his intellect because the light of God has gone out in his soul. The fearful indictment the Holy Ghost brings against mankind is summed up count by count in the opening chapters of Romans and the conduct of every man from earliest recorded history to the present moment is evidence enough to sustain the indictment.',' Romans 1:24, 26, 28',' . . .

Apart from the Scriptures we have no sure philosophy; apart from Jesus Christ we have no true knowledge of God; apart from the inliving Spirit we have no ability to live lives morally pleasing to God.

These are no longer called philosophers, lovers of wisdom, but scholars, professors, scientists, who love knowledge for itself. These are intellectual magpies with a compulsive tic that drives them to collect all the shiny bits of knowledge possible; fortunately for them there are enough others with the same tic to provide them with a means of making some kind of a living here below. 2. Seekers after honor. These are the politicians. They have an incurable itch to be known in the gates, and as a means toward this end they manage to work up a convincing if phony patriotic fever every four or six years that brings them votes and enables them to ride in the front car in the Memorial parade. Their reward is in being applauded by the masses they secretly despise, and verily they have their reward. 3. Seekers after gain. These are at the top honest businessmen who become wealthy within the law, and at the bottom racketeers who gain their wealth outside the law. Morally these latter differ not at all from the ordinary bandit, but they differ socially because they are smarter, have read a book and know a better lawyer.',' Job 27:8',' For what hope has the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?',' Knowledge, recognition and wealth-common people goals.

These no doubt existed in Pythagoras as they do in ours and it is odd that he did not recognize them. Let us add them to the list. 4. Seekers after nothing.

Thanks be to God on high that these too are among us. They are the salt of the earth and the light of the world. Their number is not large when counted against the millions who have forgotten their Maker, but taken together they are a goodly company and dear to the heart of God. Ah, those God-hungry souls! By nature they are no better than the rest of men, and by practice they have sometimes been worse. The one sign of their divine election is their insatiable thirst after the Source of their being. Deep calls unto deep and they hear and respond. These are almost always a disappointment to themselves, and sometimes they have for a while been a stumbling block to the world, as were Jacob and David and Peter. But many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it, and their questing hearts find what they seek at last. The grace of God meets them as they return and changes them from what they are sorry they have been, into what they have so fervently longed to become. Towe know what the wise Greek could not know, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses. Seekers after God there surely were even in those old Grecian times and their destiny lies in the hand of the One who gave His only-begotten Son to die for the life of the world. One word needs to be added. It will go better in the of reckoning for the seeker of pre-Christian days who stretched out pagan hands toward God in hope that he might find Him, than for the careless sinner of who is sated with hearing and who refuses to repent and believe.',' Proverbs 8:17',' I love those who seek me, and those who seek me find me.',' The God-seekers among us model to us what life is all about. How amazing that when we seek God He will be found!',' I want to be a seeker after You, Lord, not part-time or just on Sunday, but daily.'),(722,'The Set of the Sail','32',' Controversy May Have Its Holy Uses (1/3)','86',' The Great Deceiver',' The Devil is a master strategist. He varies his attacks as skillfully as an experienced general and always has one more trick to use against the one who imagines he is well experienced in the holy war. By two radically opposite things the devil seeks to destroy us-by our sins and by our virtues. First, he tempts us to sin. This might be called his conventional device. It worked against Adam and Eve and still works after the passing of the centuries. By means of it millions each year are, as Paul said, drowned in destruction and perdition. One would think the human race would learn to resist the blandishments of its sworn enemy, and it probably would except that there is an enemy within the gate-the fallen heart is secretly on the side of the devil. It is, however, Satans wiliest stratagem to use our virtues against us, and this he often does with astonishing success. By means of temptation to sin he strikes at our personal lives; by working through our virtues he gets at the whole community of believers and unfits it for its own defense. A parallel to Satans technique may be seen in the activities of certain subversive political groups who use the Constitution of the United States as a shield while they work to destroy that Constitution. By unctuous pleading for the right of free speech they seek to destroy all freedom of speech. By talking piously about government by law they push our country toward the place where there will be government by dictatorship and all laws will mean what a ruling clique of base, cynical men want them to mean. So diabolical is this method that one can only conclude that those who use it learned it from their father the devil, whose they are and whom they serve.',' Second Corinthians 11:14',' And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.',' Master deceiver that he is, Satan attacks what we consider our strengths as well as our weaknesses. He does that to us as the community of believers and as individuals. Satan is the Great Deceiver!',' O Lord, give me discernment to recognize the disguises of Satan and to resist him in Your name.'),(723,'The Set of the Sail','32',' Controversy May Have Its Holy Uses (2/3)','87',' Recognizing Satans Strategic Initiative',' Many times in history the Christians in various towns, cities and even whole countries have given up their defense for reasons wholly evil. Worldliness, sinful pleasures and personal ungodliness have often been the cause of the churchs disgraceful surrender to the enemy. Today, however, Satans strategy is different. Though he still uses the old methods where he can do so with success, his more effective method is to paralyze our resistance by appealing to our virtues, especially the virtue of charity. He first creates a maudlin and wholly inaccurate concept of Christ as soft, smiling and tolerant. He reminds us that Christ was brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth, and suggests that we go and do likewise. Then if we notice his foot in the door and rise to oppose him he appeals to our desire to be Christlike. You must not practice negative thinking, he tells us. Jesus said, He that is not against Me is for Me. Also He said Judge not, and how can you be a good Christian and pass adverse judgment on any religious talk or activity? Controversy divides the Body of Christ. Love is of God, little children, so love everybody and all will be well. Thus speaks the devil, using Holy Scripture falsely for his evil purpose; and it is nothing short of tragic how many of Gods people are taken in by his sweet talk. The shepherd becomes afraid to use his club and the wolf gets the sheep. The watchman is charmed into believing that there is no danger, and the city falls to the enemy without a shot. So Satan destroys us by appealing to our virtues.',' Matthew 16:23',' Jesus turned and said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.',' Jesus recognized the clever tactic of Satan who was using the good intentions of Peter. Remember how Satan had quoted scripture in the wilderness temptation of Jesus. We must be alert to Satans ploys.',' Lord, I struggle between the extremes of seeing Satan in everything and, on the other hand, in nothing. By Your Spirit, make me wise.'),(724,'The Set of the Sail','32',' Controversy May Have Its Holy Uses (3/3)','88',' Keep the Torch Burning',' The clever proponents of evil political ideologies are spending millions to make us Americans ashamed to love our country. By the use of all available media of communication they are persuading our people that there is little left worth defending and certainly nothing worth dying for. They are building up in the public mind a picture of an American as a generous, tolerant, smiling chap who loves baseball and babies but is not too much concerned about fringe political theories. This synthetic American subscribes to the doctrine of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man and lets go fishing-everything will be all right. And so in religion, especially among the Protestants. Let a man rise to declare the unique Lordship of Jesus Christ and the absolute necessity of obedience to Him and he is at once branded as a hatemonger and a divider of men. The devil has brainwashed large numbers of religious leaders so successfully that they are now too timid to resist him. And he, being the kind of devil he is, takes swift advantage of their cowardice to erect altars to Baal everywhere. The Bible is a book of controversy. The Old Testament prophets were men of contention. Our Lord Jesus while on earth was in deadly conflict with the devil. The Apostles, the Church Fathers and the Reformers were men of controversy. They fought the devil to the death and kept the torch of truth burning for all succeeding generations. Is our contribution to history to be the ignoble one of letting the torch go out?',' Ephesians 6:10-11',' Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devils schemes.',' Tolerance is promoted as the paramount virtue in contemporary culture. Intolerance is the great sin. Yet the Torch of Truth must be kept burning!',' Lord, I want to be strong in You and in Your power. Remind me to use all the armor You have provided by which to stand against devilish schemes.'),(725,'The Set of the Sail','33',' The True Motive for Christian Conduct (1/4)','89',' The Primacy of Self',' Selfish personal interest, says the Greek moral philosopher Epictetus, is the motive behind all human conduct. The children of the world, Christ tells us, are often wiser than the children of light. In his discovery of the springs of human conduct Epictetus reveals an understanding of mankind far beyond that of the average Christian; and this in spite of the fact that the Christian claims to possess the Spirit of truth and the Greek did not. If we would be wise in the wisdom of God we must face up to the truth no matter how uncomplimentary it may be to us. It would be more comfortable to shrug off what our eyes behold and loyally declare our belief in the intrinsic goodness of all men; but our eternal welfare forbids that we deal dishonestly with reality. The truth is, men are not basically good; they are basically evil, and the essence of their sin lies in their selfishness. The putting of our own interests before the glory of God is sin in its Godward aspect, and the putting of our own interests before those of our fellow men is sin as it relates to society. We know men are sinners because when they must choose between others and themselves they choose themselves every time. Personal interest sees to that.',' Jeremiah 17:9',' The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?',' If we would live out Christs love we will have to renounce the primacy of self. We do that by taking up our cross daily by the Spirits enablement.',' Forgive me, Lord. Self so often gets in the way. Help me to nail it tighter to the cross.'),(726,'The Set of the Sail','33',' The True Motive for Christian Conduct (2/4)','90',' When Interests Collide',' Whether we are considering two men or two nations we see how personal interest controls their relation to each other. Two men can live together in perfect harmony as long as their interests coincide. Indeed it might correctly be said that human society can exist only by organizing itself in such a manner as to serve the interests of the majority of persons composing it, or at least of those persons who are in a position to fight for their rights. As long as their interests do not conflict nations may for centuries live side by side in peace; when a shift in population or a change in the economic structure takes place nations that have been friends for generations may suddenly become enemies. Hostility between nations or blocks of nations can always be traced to a clash of personal interest. All wars arise out of a collision of interests and must for that reason be recognized as a manifestation of sin. From whence come wars and fightings among you? asks James, come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?',' James 4:1',' What causes fights and quarrels among you? Dont they come from your desires that battle within you?',' Do our selfish interests collide with Christs Lordship? Are we wholly His or just partially so?',' Thank You, Father, for Your patience with me. Often my own selfish interests intrude to challenge the Lordship of Christ. Forgive me.'),(727,'The Set of the Sail','33',' The True Motive for Christian Conduct (3/4)','91',' God-Centered and Other-Centered Living',' Human society is built upon a balance of personal interests. People are so used to seeing everyone serving his own ends that no other kind of conduct is expected. Only the eccentric dreamer would expect that unregenerate men could be persuaded to surrender their personal rights and devote themselves wholly to the interests of others. Occasionally small groups of persons have come together to try to form a selfless society, but in every instance they have lived to see their little utopia tear itself apart by the centrifugal force generated by the very selfishness they were trying so nobly to escape. The human heart is essentially selfish and it cannot be cured by external organization. With the advent of Jesus Christ a new and radically different motive for human conduct was introduced into the world and its symbol is the cross. By His words Christ exposed the evil of self-interest and by His cross He demonstrated pure selfless love in its fullest perfection. He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many. Christ pleased not Himself, but lived in total devotion to the honor of God and the welfare of mankind, and when He died He set a crown of beauty upon a God-centered and an others-centered life.',' Matthew 10:38-39',' And anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whosoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.',' Whoever loses his life for Christs sake finds it. It is an altogether new life redirected away from self and centered in God and others. It is Christlike living!',' Lord, it seems so threatening, even frightening, to let loose of self and sink into Christs life. May I have the good sense to do it.'),(728,'The Set of the Sail','33',' The True Motive for Christian Conduct (4/4)','92',' New Testament Christianity and Ours',' The cross is a symbol of the selfless, others-centered life of Christ, but it does not end there. Our Lord made it also a symbol of the normal Christian life. If any man will come after me, He said, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. The teaching here is too plain to miss. The self-interest motive in our conduct, though it is inherent in fallen human nature, is nevertheless an evil and destructive thing that can lead at last only to tragic and everlasting loss. Love alone can make our conduct acceptable to God. It is time we checked our brand of Christianity against the New Testament. There is real danger that we may overlook this radical new motive for human conduct and go on serving our own interests under a disguise of godliness. And that is a mistake none of us can afford to make.',' Galatians 6:14',' May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.',' To most of us the cross is far too symbolic. We fail to see it as it is-an instrument of death, our death. This that we may experience Christs life.',' In Your cross, O Christ I glory. May I not forget to carry mine.'),(729,'The Set of the Sail','34',' Why Faith Is Indispensable (1/4)','93',' Humankinds Special Relationship to God',' Without faith it is impossible to please God has become an axiom of the Christian way; yet I suppose not many stop to ask why faith should be so vitally important in our relation with God. But there is a reason. This is a moral universe. At bottom it is not material, though it contains matter; it is not mathematical, though it involves numbers. The God who made the world is a moral being and He has filled His world with moral creatures. We hear of mysterious beings who have access to the presence of God and who range throughout the whole creation as servants of the Most High. Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. The Scriptures tell us of at least four orders of such beings and refer to what they call watchers and holy ones, which may indicate other orders or may simply refer to the previously mentioned four. In addition, there is another and of course a more familiar order of being, the last and (before his fall) the highest of all the creatures God created and made. I refer to man who was made in Gods image and likeness and who for that reason bears toward God a unique moral and spiritual relation.',' Genesis 5:22, 24',' . . . Enoch walked with God . . . Enoch walked with God . ..',' Enoch walked with God. Also reported to have walked with Him are Noah, Abraham and Isaac. To walk humbly with God is our unique privilege. What other segment of creation is so honored?',' Enoch walked with You, Lord. I can, too! I want to know what it means to so relate to You.'),(730,'The Set of the Sail','34',' Why Faith Is Indispensable (2/4)','94',' Gods Character Is Infinitely Holy',' Because this is a moral universe, character, which is the excellence of moral beings, is naturally paramount. As the excellence of steel is strength and the excellence of art is beauty, so the excellence of mankind is moral character. An honest man is the noblest work of God, an apothegm usually attributed to John Wesley, may sound at first rather extreme, but if we allow the word honest to stand for all the moral virtues we may be able to understand the apothegm and possibly to agree with it. A saint should be not only a man of intense spiritual devotion but a man of symmetrical virtues and perfectly balanced character. Relationship between moral beings is by confidence, and confidence rests upon character, which is a guarantee of conduct. It is true that sin has introduced confusion into the world so that we do not always find consistency of moral conduct among men; yet to live in a moral world it is necessary that we put confidence in our fellow man. A complete breakdown of confidence would destroy the adhesive quality of society, tear apart the fabric of civilization and turn the world into a cage of savage beasts. However bad men may at times become they must still trust each other. It is either confidence or chaos. What has all this to do with faith in God? Just this: God is a being of supreme moral excellence, possessing in infinite perfection all the qualities that constitute holy character. He deserves and invites the unreserved confidence of every moral creature, including man. Any proper relation to Him must be by confidence, that is, by faith. Where there is no faith it is impossible to please God.',' Second Samuel 7:28',' O Sovereign LORD, you are God! Your words are trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant.',' Gods character is altogether impeccable. We may fully trust Him even though we will certainly not always understand Him since He is God. Because of who He is, lets fully trust Him!',' You have never failed me, Father. On the basis of the past I can trust You for the future and today.'),(731,'The Set of the Sail','34',' Why Faith Is Indispensable (3/4)','95',' Acting Out Unbelief',' Human sin began with loss of faith in God. When our mother Eve listened to Satans sly innuendoes against the character of God she began to entertain a doubt of His integrity and right there the doors were opened to the incoming of every possible evil, and darkness settled upon the world. The Bible talks about mans being alienated from and an enemy to God. Should this sound harsh or extreme you have only to imagine your closest personal friend coming to you and stating in cold seriousness that he no longer has any confidence in you. I do not trust you. I have lost confidence in your character. I am forced to suspect every move you make. Such a declaration would instantly alienate friends by destroying the foundation upon which every friendship is built. Until your former friends opinion of you had been reversed there could be no further communion. Only a restored faith could bring about a restored friendship. Now, it is well known that people do not go boldly to God and profess that they have no confidence in Him, and no one except the rare professional unbeliever is willing to witness publicly to his low view of God. The frightful thing, however, is that people everywhere act out their unbelief with a consistency that is more convincing than words.',' Matthew 14:31',' Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. You of little faith, he said, why did you doubt?',' Why do we doubt God? Is there a question about His character or His power? We often attempt to hide our doubt but it is evident in our prayer and our daily living, isnt it?',' Forgive me for doubting You, Lord. It is often covered over with faith-talk. But only You can be fully trusted.'),(732,'The Set of the Sail','34',' Why Faith Is Indispensable (4/4)','96',' Trusting the Completely Trustworthy God',' Idolatry is the supreme sin and unbelief is the child of idolatry. Both are libels on the character of the Most High and the Most Holy. He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, wrote the apostle John. A God who lies is a God without character, and where there is no character there can be no confidence. This is the moral logic of unbelief. The unbeliever refuses to trust God because his conception of God is base and ignoble. That he does not burn incense to a graven image does not make him less an idolater, unless we want to make a distinction and say that the idolater worships his false god while the unbeliever refuses to do even that. The joyous message of Christianity is that there is a way back from this place of unbelief and alienation. He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. The gospel message declares that the wronged God took the wrong upon Himself in order that the one who committed the wrong might be saved. Repentance is among other things a sincere apology to God for distrusting Him so long, and faith is throwing oneself upon Christ in complete confidence. Thus by faith reconciliation is achieved between God and man.',' Mark 6:5-6',' He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. And he was amazed at their lack of faith.',' How much do we limit the display of Gods power by our unbelief? God alone is worthy of our complete trust even when we dont always understand His ways.',' Lord, is it my weak faith alone that hinders Your working in and through me? Or is it a propensity to pride on my part, to take glory that belongs to You? Lead me, O God, into complete trust in You.'),(733,'The Set of the Sail','35','The Bed of Procrustes',NULL,'Those Unusual Bereans','Legend tells of Procrustes, the Greek bandit, who forced his victims to lie on a certain bed.

No institution can add to or take from the original human stuff the student brings to class with him. After years of observation I am forced to conclude that some persons simply cannot profit from their educational opportunities. Beyond providing them with a few items of information they might not otherwise acquire, a college course does them little good. Their years of enforced study leave them without improved tastes, without perspective and without wisdom.

This was also the teaching of Paul, James and John (2 Corinthians 6:14-18; James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17). It is therefore of critical importance that we who claim to be disciples of Christ should check our relation to the world.\r\nThe question of the Christian and the world is not, however, as simple as it might seem.

In the working creed of the average Christian salvation is held to be immediate and automatic, while discipleship is thought to be something optional which the Christian may delay indefinitely or never accept at all. <P>It is not uncommon to hear Christian workers urging seekers to accept Christ now and leave moral and social questions to be decided later. The notion is that obedience and discipleship are unrelated to salvation. We may be saved by believing a historic fact about Jesus Christ (that He died for our sins and rose again) and applying this to our personal situation. The whole biblical concept of Lordship and obedience is completely absent from the mind of the seeker. He needs help, and Christ is the very one, even the only one, who can furnish it, so he “takes” Him as his personal Savior. The idea of His Lordship is completely ignored. ',' Luke 9:23','Then he said to them all: \'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.\' ','Can we receive Christ as Savior and deny His lordship over us?

I name a few. <P><i>Pietism</i>.By this I mean an enjoyable feeling of affection for the person of our Lord which is valued for itself and is wholly unrelated to cross-bearing or the keeping of the commandments of Christ. <P>It is entirely possible to feel for Jesus an ardent love which is not of the Holy Spirit. Witness the love for the Virgin felt by certain devout souls, a love which in the very nature of things must be purely subjective. The heart is adept at emotional tricks and is entirely capable of falling in love with imaginary objects or romantic religious ideas. <P>In the confused world of romance young persons are constantly inquiring how they can tell when they are in love. They are afraid they may mistake some other sensation for true love and are seeking some trustworthy criterion by which they can judge the quality of their latest emotional fever. Their confusion of course arises from the erroneous notion that love is an enjoyable inward passion, without intellectual or volitional qualities and carrying with it no moral obligations. <P>Our Lord gave us a rule by which we can test our love for Him: He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him. . . .  If a man love me, he will keep my words. . . He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings (John 14:21-24). <P>These words are too plain to need much interpreting. Proof of love for Christ is simply removed altogether from the realm of the feelings and placed in the realm of practical obedience. I think the rest of the New Testament is in full accord with this.\r\n',' John 14:23-24a','Jesus replied, If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching.

Literalism manifests itself among us in many ways, but it can always be identified in that it lives by the letter of the Word while ignoring its spirit. It habitually fails to apprehend the inward meaning of Christs words, and contents itself with external compliance with the text. If Christ commands baptism, for instance, it finds fulfillment in the act of water baptism, but the radical meaning of the act as explained in Romans 6 is completely overlooked. It reads the Scriptures regularly, contributes consistently to religious work, attends church every Sunday and otherwise carries on the common duties of a Christian and for this it is to be commended. Its tragic breakdown is its failure to comprehend the Lordship of Christ, the believers discipleship, separation from the world and the crucifixion of the natural man.<P>Literalism attempts to build a holy temple upon the sandy foundation of the religious self. It will suffer, sacrifice and labor, but it will not die.

The what and the how of Christian service can only originate in the sovereign will of our Lord, but the busy beavers among us ignore this fact and think up their own schemes.

The word \'whosoever\' throws the door open wide, indeed, but the church in recent years has carried the gospel invitation far beyond its proper bounds and turned it into something more human and less divine than that found in the sacred Scriptures.<BR><BR>\r\n	What we tend to overlook is that the word \'whosoever\' never stands by itself. Always its meaning is modified by the word \'believe\' or \'will\' or \'come\'. According to the teachings of Christ no man will or can come and believe unless there has been done within him a prevenient work of God enabling him so to do.\r\n','John 6:44','No one can come to me unless the Father draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.','The verb translated <i>draw</i> is used of Peter drawing his sword (John 18:10); of Peter dragging fishing nets (John 21:6. 11); of Paul and Silas dragged from the temple (Acts 21:30).

No one can come of himself; he must first be drawn by the Father (John 6:44). 3. The ability to come to Christ is a gift of the Father (John 6:65). 4. Everyone given to the Son by the Father will come to Him (John 6:37)<BR><BR>\r\n	It is not surprising that upon hearing these words many of our Lord\'s disciples went back and walked no more with Him. Such teaching cannot but be deeply disturbing to the natural mind. It takes from sinful men much of the power of self-determination upon which they had prided themselves so inordinately. It cuts the ground out from under their self-help and throws them back upon the sovereign good pleasure of God, and that is precisely where they do not want to be. They are willing to be saved by grace, but to preserve their self-esteem they must hold that the desire to be saved originated with them; this desire is their contribution to the whole thing, their offering of the fruit of the ground, and it keeps salvation in their hands where in truth it is not and can never be.<BR><BR>\r\n	Admitting the difficulties this creates for us, and acknowledging that it runs contrary to the assumptions of popular Christianity, it is yet impossible to deny that there are certain persons who, though still unconverted, are nevertheless different from the crowd, marked out of God, stricken with an interior wound and susceptible to the call of Christ to a degree others are not.','John 6:37','All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.','As believers we are the Father\'s gift to Christ.

As long as we can keep the whole thing at arm\'s length and deal with it academically we may preach and write about it at little or no real cost to ourselves and, it must be admitted, with no real advance in godliness.\r\n','Colossians 2:9-10','\'\'For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.\'\'\r\n','The Church will experience revival, spiritual renewal only as we experience it.

To carry on these activities scripturally the church should be walking in fullness of power, separated, purified and ready at any moment to give up everything, even life itself, for the greater glory of Christ.

Whatever this is, it is not Christianity.<BR><BR>\r\n	A number of popular religious books have appeared of late quite literally filled with swivel-words of uncertain meaning; and because these were written by persons ostensibly evangelical they have been accepted and promoted by the evangelicals.

One thing taught large in the Holy Scriptures is that while God gives His gifts freely, He will require a strict accounting of them at the end of the road. Each man is personally responsible for his store, be it large or small, and will be required to explain his use of it before the judgment seat of Christ. The “store” is nothing new, just the old familiar list of human possessions: time, talents, earthly goods, opportunities.

None of us has much of it. The crow that flaps across the meadow will probably live longer than the oldest one of us. The tree that shades the sleepy cow in the pasture may have looked down on our grandfather when he was a boy, and it may remain to watch the passing of our children’s children. And that we have so small a store of time constitutes a powerful reason for our making the most of what we have. Yet how many hours have we spent doing nothing or doing the wrong thing. Our cynical waste of precious time could be a reason for our not having more of it given to us, who \r\nknows? Jesus once said, “Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.” Time wasted is lost beyond recall. While we sympathize with the emotional content of the old song, Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight,” it is yet hard to conceive of a more futile appeal. Time does not run backward. The old man does not become young, the young man becomes old. So it has always been and so it will ever be. The bird of time flies past us and is gone; “the leaves of life keep \r\nfalling one by one, the wine of life keeps oozing drop by drop.” We must work while it is called today.','First Corinthians 7:29a','What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. . . .','Jesus had no more time in His sojourn on earth than most of us.  He had less years than most of us have \r\nalready lived.  Knowing full well the brevity of His earthly life and the value of His time, He spent so \r\nmuch of it in discipling the Twelve.','Lord, I\'m a waster of time.  Forgive me.

These are included in the total store granted us by our Heavenly Father. Whether we have one talent or many, we must render up account finally, and the factor that will decide for us is not how many talents we had but what we did with them. The story of the man who hid his talent in the ground makes disquieting reading for the careless Christian who is failing to make use of his gifts. Some with modest gifts have made a brilliant record of spiritual achievement; others with far greater abilities have played through the summer of life like the grasshopper in the fable and have let their gifts lie unused while time idled by. This, we repeat, is tragedy, and that it is common does not make it any the less tragic. \n<i>Money<i/> is another item. American Christians make so much of it and spend it so lavishly that they have unconsciously learned to take it as a matter for granted and have forgotten that they will be strictly judged for their use of it. The Lord still stands by the treasury and observes what is placed therein. This has been turned into a joke by humorists who are ready always to find something funny in every reference to money. But it is safe to predict that there will be little laughter when the Lord with eyes like a flame of fire looks into our accounts and makes His just audit. We might do well right now to do a little auditing ourselves while there is time to make amends for our failures.','Romans 12:7a','We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. . . .','We have differing gifts, natural talents, human resources — all grace gifts from God.

The wise Christian will watch for opportunities to do good, to speak the life-bringing word to sinners, to pray the rescuing prayer of intercession.\nThe foe of opportunity is preoccupation. Just when God sends along a chance to turn a great victory for mankind, some of us are too busy puttering around to notice it. Or we notice it when it is too late. The old Greeks said that opportunity had a forelock but was close-shaven behind; if a man missed grabbing for her as she approached, he would reach for her in vain after she had passed.\nPossibly the worst effect of waste is the mental habit it creates. To allow time or money or talents to go to waste is to do something harmful to ourselves. It is to injure ourselves inside where it is most serious.','Ephesians 5:15-16','Be very careful, then, how you live — not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.','Wise living is making the most of opportunities.

The price may seem excessively heavy, but there are some who consider the reward worthwhile.\nThe laws of success operate also in the higher field of the soul — spiritual greatness has its price. Eminence in the things of the Spirit demands a devotion to these things more complete than most of us are willing to give. But the law cannot be escaped. If we would be holy we know the way; the law of holy living is before us. The prophets of the Old Testament, the apostles of the New and, more than all, the sublime teachings of Christ are there to tell us how to succeed.','Colossians 3:2','Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.','Our minds are so much set on things earthly and so little on things above.

The nation whose soldiers were as soft and undisciplined as the soldiers of the churches would be conquered by the first enemy that attacked it. Triumphs are not won by men in easy chairs. Success is costly.\r\n<p>If we would progress spiritually, we must separate ourselves unto the things of God and concentrate upon them to the exclusion of a thousand things the worldly man considers important.

Undeterred, Nehemiah replied with firm assurance, \"The God of heaven, he will prosper us.\" And the work went on according to plan.\nAfter all other means had failed to hinder the reconstruction, the conspirators tried to arrange for a conference with Nehemiah. The man of God saw in this an evil purpose to do him mischief and divert him from his monumental work. His reply to the would-be mischief-makers is classic, and might well be adopted for the all-time stock reply to all such overtures: \"I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?\" (Nehemiah 6:3).\nThe great task to which God had called Nehemiah was so important that every other consideration must be waived.

God has so ordered things that His children may grow as successfully in the middle of a desert as in the most fruitful land. It is necessary that this should be so, seeing that the very world itself is a field where nothing good can grow except by some kind of miracle. The old hymn asks the rhetorical question, \"Is this vile world a friend to grace, to help me on to God?\" And the implied answer is no.

There is not on earth a lonely spot where a Christian cannot live and be spiritually victorious if God sends him there. He carries his own climate with him or has it supplied supernaturally when he arrives. Since he is not dependent for his spiritual health upon local moral standards or current religious beliefs, he lives through a thousand earthly changes, unaffected by any of them. He has a private supply from above and is in reality a little world within a world and very much of a wonder to the rest of creation.\r\n<p>Because this is true, we can easily see why we should never blame our spiritual failures on others.

By losing the divine content from the concept of love, modern man now has remaining only what we might expect — a brazen-faced dowd whom he courts at all hours of the day and night with songs that should make a chimpanzee blush.','Romans 5:8','But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.','In common usage love is denigrated. But in its fullest expression love is Christ dying for <i>for us while we were yet sinners!<i/>','O Christ, it would be more comprehensible had You died for me after I was fully transformed into Your image.

O what love!'),(816,'We Travel an Appointed Way','15','\"Love Is the Will To, the Intention\"',NULL,'Willing to Love','Civilized man has brought about this tragic fall by associating love with sex exclusively and then popularizing the error by every means at his command. Millions of young people today are wholly unable to think of love except in terms of the disgraceful promiscuity of Hollywood. Newspapers now report the numerous marriages of the movie crowd by number: \"It was the third marriage for her; his fourth.\" And if it were not so tragic for everyone concerned, it would be hugely comical to read of a movie star being interviewed by the press and solemnly assuring the public that she is not at the moment \"in love.\" Such a use of the word is completely degraded and smacks more of the beasts than of men made in the image of God.\r\n<p>For the millions, love is an emotional attraction, nothing more, as unstable and as unpredictable as sheet lightning. The Bible teaches, on the contrary, that true love is a benevolent principle and <i>is under the control of the will.<i/> If love were merely an emotion, how could God command us to love Him, or to love our neighbor? No one can \"fall in love\" at the command of another, if falling in love means getting seized suddenly with a fit of love as one might be hit with a charge of electricity or caught with a severe spasm of coughing.','1 Thessalonians 3:12','May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.','There is friendship love, erotic love and family love. Then there is <i>agape<i/> love primarily based not on emotion or dependent on reciprocity but on the will — willing to love.','I understand, Lord, that I can choose to love or not to love.

We may not in a thousand years be able to feel a surge of emotion toward certain \"neighbors,\" but we can go before God and solemnly will to love them, and the love will come. By prayer and an application of the inworking power of God, we may set our faces to will the good of our neighbor and not his evil all the days of our lives, and that is love. The emotion may follow, or there may be no appreciable change in our feelings toward him, but the intention is what matters. We will his peace and prosperity and put ourselves at his disposal to help him in every way possible, even to the laying down of our lives for his sake.\r\n<p>Love, then, is a principle of good will and is to a large extent under our control. That it can be fanned into a blazing fire is not denied here. Certainly God\'s love for us has a mighty charge of feeling in it, but beneath it all is a set principle that wills our peace. Probably the love of God for mankind was never more beautifully stated than by the angel at the birth of Christ: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to man on whom his favor rests.\"','Galatians 5:22a','But the fruit of the Spirit is love . . .','Loving with <i>agape<i/> love is choosing, willing to direct God\'s love to specific people whether or not they are loveable or responsive.

Whoever sticks to his own side is forever wrong.\r\n<p>The points at which God\'s way and man\'s intersect are likely to be four (though there may be others), and we will usually find our differences with God to occur somewhere in these four areas.\r\n<p>First, <i>our thoughts.</i> Divine inspiration has declared that the thoughts of man are vain, and in the prophecy of Isaiah, God sets His case before us so plainly that comment is hardly necessary: \"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,\" declares the Lord. \"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts\" (Isaiah 55:8-9).','Isaiah 55:8','\'For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,\' declares the LORD.','Living on God\'s side involves embracing God\'s thoughts as a habit of life.

The test is not which code is best but whether or not any code agrees with the Scriptures. In the Christian Scriptures, the Lord of the whole earth declares His own moral will for mankind, and it is profound wisdom to seek it and conform to it. Otherwise, we are at the mercy of our own deceitful hearts. For all men of faith, God\'s will is righteousness. The believing soul will not argue about it; he will accept it and bring the controversy to an end.\r\n<p>The third point of possible controversy is in our <i>way of life.</i> This embraces the whole of our lives on earth as decided by our basic moral ideas. Our way of life is simply our moral code in its daily outflow.\r\np>The fourth is <i>our plans.</i> The Christian who has in principle accepted God\'s truth as his standard of conduct and has submitted himself to Christ as his Lord, may yet be tempted to lay his own plans and even fight for them when they are challenged by the Word of God or the inner voice of the Spirit. We humans are a calculating, planning race, and we like to say, \"Tomorrow I will . . .\" But our Heavenly Father knows us too well to trust our way to our own planning, so He very often submits His own plans to us and requires that we accept them. Right there a controversy is sometimes stirred up between the soul and God. But we had better not insist on our own way. It will always be bad for us in the long run. God\'s way is best.','Joshua 24:15','But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve. . . . But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.\"','Our daily living is the most accurate indicator of our true moral standards and life priorities.

Pros and cons are often balanced so finely against each other that it is virtually impossible to know where the right lies. But with God there is only one side. God\'s side is good and holy and all other sides are wrong, the degree and seriousness of the wrong increasing as we move away from the center of God\'s will.\r\n<p>Our desire for moral self-preservation should dictate that we come over immediately onto God\'s side and stay there even if (as is likely) it may result in our being out of accord with man\'s philosophies and man\'s moral codes. We cannot win when we work against God, and we cannot lose when we work with Him.\r\n<p>Now, how can we know for certain which side is God\'s side? No one in this late day should need to ask that question, but since it is being asked in all sincerity by many, we are glad to give the answer. There is a Book which says of itself, \"And God spoke all these words,\" and about which it is said, \"Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up to glory\" (1 Timothy 3:16).

God could answer her prayer because He did not need to mince matters with her. She did not hedge her prayers around with disclaimers and provisos. She wanted certain things from God at any cost. God, as it were, had only to send her the bill. She would pay any price to get what she conceived to be good for her soul and glorifying to her Heavenly Father. That is real praying.\r\n<p>Many of us spoil our prayers by being too \"dainty\" with the Lord (as some old writer called it). We ask with the tacit understanding that the cost must be reasonable.

We want nothing radical or out of the ordinary, and we want God to accommodate us at our convenience. Thus we attach a rider to every prayer, making it impossible for God to answer it.','Matthew 26:39','Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, \'My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me.

Then we must throw ourselves before Him and pray with boldness for whatever we know our good and His glory require, and the cost is no object! Whatever He in His love and wisdom would assess against us, we will accept with delight because it pleased Him. Prayers like that cannot go unanswered.

A bank-teller psychology characterizes much of the religious thinking in our little gospel circle. The tragedy of it is that it is truth without being all the truth.\r\n<p>If modern Christians are to approach the spiritual greatness of Bible saints or know the inward delights of the saints of post-biblical times, they must correct this imperfect view and cultivate the beauties of the Lord our God in sweet, personal experience. In achieving such a happy state, a good hymnbook will help more than any other book in the world except the Bible itself.\r\n<p>A great hymn embodies the purest concentrated thoughts of some lofty saint who may have long ago gone from the earth and left little or nothing behind him except that hymn. To read or sing a true hymn is to join in the act of worship with a great and gifted soul in his moments of intimate devotion. It is to hear a lover of Christ explaining to his Savior why he loves Him; it is to listen in without embarrassment on the softest whisperings of undying love between the bride and the heavenly Bridegroom.','Ephesians 5:19b-20','. . .

It is as simple as that. \r\n<p>We often hear the axiom \"Practice makes perfect.\" The fact is that practice, far from making perfect, actually confirms us in our faults unless it is carried on in a humble, self-critical spirit. The whole philosophy of instruction rests upon the idea that the learner is wrong and is seeking to be made right. No teacher can correct his pupil unless the pupil comes to him in humility. The only proper attitude for the learner is one of humble self-distrust. \"I am ignorant,\" he says, \"and am willing to be taught. I am wrong and am willing to be corrected.\" In this childlike spirit, the mind is made capable of improvement.','First Corinthians 11:31','But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment.','Isn\'t it better to judge ourselves before somebody else does it?

Paul said, \"Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me\" (Philippians 3:12).\r\n<p>Some Christians hope in a vague kind of way that time will help them to grow better. They look to the passing of the years to mellow them and make them more Christlike. This is such a tender and pathetic thought that one hesitates to expose its essential error. But we had better know the facts now while we can do something about them rather than go on moist-eyed and dreamily hopeful — and wholly wrong. A crooked tree does not straighten with age; neither does a crooked Christian.\r\n<p>All this is to say that a growing Christian must have at his roots the life-giving waters of penitence. The cultivation of a penitential spirit is absolutely essential to spiritual progress. The lives of great saints teach us that self-distrust is vital to godliness. Even while the obedient soul lies prostrate before God, or goes on in reverent obedience convinced that he is carrying out the will of God with a perfect conscience, he will yet feel a sense of utter brokenness and a deep consciousness that he is still far from being what he ought to be. This is one of the many paradoxical situations in which the humble man will find himself as he follows on to know the Lord.','Hebrews 12:1b-2a','. . . let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.

We mention it only to point up the truth under present consideration and to show by horrible example what long continued self-assurance will do to a human character. Let the public accept a man as unusual, and he is soon tempted to accept himself as being above reproof. Soon a hard shell of impenitence covers his heart and chokes his spiritual life almost out of existence. The cure, if there is to be a cure, would be simple, of course. Let him look to his past and to the cross where Jesus died. If he can still defend himself after that, then let him look into his own heart and tell what he finds there. If after that he can still boast, close the coffin lid.\r\n<p>We might point out a danger here (for there will always be perils in the way of spiritual progress): it is that we become morbidly introspective and lose the legitimate happy cheer from our souls. This we must never do, and we can avoid it by permitting Christ to engage our attention, rather than our own souls. The safe rule is, whenever we look at ourselves, be penitent; when we look at Christ, be joyous.

He does not need our pity.\r\n<p>But from Paul and his afflictions we may learn much truth, some of it depressing and some altogether elevating and wonderful. We may learn, for instance, that malice needs nothing to live on; it can feed on itself. A contentious spirit will find something to quarrel about. A faultfinder will find occasion to accuse a Christian even if his life is as chaste as an icicle and pure as snow. A man of ill will does not hesitate to attack, even if the object of his hatred be a prophet or the very Son of God Himself. If John comes fasting, he says he has a devil; if Christ comes eating and drinking, he says He is a winebibber and a glutton.

But possibly these thoughts will prove helpful to any who may be confused about the nature of spiritual evidence.\r\n<p>There is such a thing as the secret workings of the Spirit in the soul of man, for a time unknown and unsuspected by the individual. In fact, most of the fruits of the Spirit are unsuspected by the man in whom they are found. The most loving, most patient, most compassionate soul is unlikely to be aware of these graces. He is almost certain to believe that he is anything but loving or patient or kind. Others will discover the operations of the Spirit within him long before he will and will thank God for his sweet Christian character while he may at the same time be walking in great humility before God, mourning the absence of the very graces that others know he possesses.','Galatians 5:22-23','But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.

These strange workings within are the stirrings of the Holy Spirit but are rarely identified as such by the soul that is undergoing the experience.\r\n<p>But there are two acts of God within the life of the seeking man that are never done without his knowledge. One is the miracle of the new birth and the other is the anointing of the Holy Spirit.\r\n<p>Of the new birth, Paul explicitly states, \"The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit, that we are God\'s children\" (Romans 8:16), and John says, \"Anyone who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in his heart\" (1 John 5:10). These passages declare the <i>fact<i/> of a divine witness but do not state the <i>nature<i/> of it. This has made it possible for various people to read into it their own peculiar psychological reactions and set up those reactions as criteria by which they judge the spiritual claims of everyone. Some at the time of their conversion have felt unusually light on their feet; others have heard voices or seen lights or felt an unseen hand pass over them. In some places, the new convert must shout aloud or his profession is not accepted.','Romans 8:16','The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God\'s children.','Despite our personality, emotional and experiential differences, we can all know the witness of the Spirit with our spirit that we are children of God.

Some go so far as to declare bluntly that no one is filled with the Spirit who has not experienced certain physical phenomena, particularly the act of speaking in unidentified tongues. Others will settle for an increased degree of joy or more effectiveness in their service.\r\n<p>All this is wrong, both scripturally and psychologically.

And the grocer will know it too, and the old cronies in the haunts where the man used to hang out will suspect that something has happened when they miss the new Christian from his accustomed place.

For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.','Eloquence and knowledge are major weapons in Satan\'s arsenal to render ineffective God\'s servants.

I am slow of speech and tongue\" (Exodus 4:10). The Lord did not try to cheer up His doubting servant by telling him that he had misjudged his ability. He allowed Moses\' statement to stand unchallenged. But He said to Moses, \"What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well.\" God gave Aaron an \"A\" in speech. He was undoubtedly an eloquent man. Yet it was the halting Moses, not the fluent Aaron, who faced Pharaoh time after time in defense of Israel; it was Moses, not the eloquent Aaron, who wrote the brilliant and beautiful story of the creation; it was Moses who penned the Book of Deuteronomy, one of the most poetical and moving books ever written. Was Aaron too fluent for God to use after all? I do not claim to know why, but whatever the reason, we have but few samples of Aaron\'s words in the Bible and countless pages of Moses\'.\r\n<p>The reason back of all this is that great emotions rarely produce fluency of speech, whereas shallow feelings are sure to express themselves in many words. We tend to use words in inverse proportion to the depth of our feelings. Some of the profoundest emotions of the heart utter themselves in a chaste brevity of words, as when John tells us of Christ\'s sharp grief at the grave of Lazarus. He says simply, \"Jesus wept.\" With exquisite good taste, the scholars who divided the Bible into verses allowed those two words to stand alone. Nothing more is needed to reveal the mighty depth of Christ\'s love for His friend.','Exodus 4:10','Moses said to the LORD, \'O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant.

The reason for the difference is of course that the evangelists <i>felt<i/> the crucifixion and instinctively spoke of it in few words.\r\n<p>To follow this thought further, it is only necessary to note the simple brevity of the announcement of our Lord\'s resurrection. The \"young man\" told the inquiring disciples the story in three words: \"He is risen.\" These needed no eloquent preface to such a wondrous announcement. Where there have been mighty deeds, there need be no multitude of words to tell of them.

The most halting speaker seems to become unusually fluent when he kneels to pray, especially when he has an audience. I have heard much flowery speech in the prayer room, and I suppose I have uttered a good deal of it. But again, there is no reason for continuing to utter words without wisdom.

After the purity of the text has been established and the mind assured that the translation is trustworthy, the best source of true light is always the Spirit-illuminated heart. A praying heart, aglow with love for God, will intuit truth, will pass behind the veil and see and hear that which is not lawful to be uttered, which indeed cannot be uttered or even intellectually understood.\r\n<p>It is my opinion that the real battle line in the theological war today is not the line that separates fundamentalism from liberalism. That war has been fought and won. No one need be in any wise confused on the question of Bible theology versus man-conceived liberalism. Both sides have said their say boldly. Everyone can know where he stands on such matters as the inspiration of the Scriptures, the deity of Jesus Christ, salvation through the blood of atonement, death and judgment, heaven and hell. The true battle line is elsewhere.','1 Corinthians 2:9-10','However, as it is written: \'No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him\' — but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit.','Spiritual truth is spiritually discerned.

Destructive elements are being innocently introduced into present-day worship and service by Bible-loving evangelicals, elements so opposed to the true genius of Christianity that the two are mutually exclusive. One or the other must go. Either these new parasitic growths must be destroyed, or they will in a short time destroy the Christian faith. Yet these deadly things are encouraged in the churches by some of the most zealous orthodox leaders. Why?\r\n<p>The answer is simpler than we might suppose. These leaders are depending on their brain to guide them in their religious practices. They conceive the truth to be a doctrinal deposit, a kind of a theological road map to lead them to heaven. They check the map to make sure they are going the right direction, and after that they are on their own. No Unseen Guide is necessary. If they should be attacked by doubts, they need only stop under a lamppost and reassure themselves that they have indeed \"accepted\" Christ. Then they get underway again with complete confidence that they are on the same road as the apostles and prophets.','Psalm 46:10','Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.','Do we need to turn down the sound systems, deemphasize the tempo, reduce the chatter and just be quiet before the Lord?

Men have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. The text alone will not elevate the moral life. To become morally effective, the truth must be accompanied by a mystic element, the very element supplied by the Spirit of truth. The Holy Spirit will not be banished to a footnote without taking terrible vengeance against His banishers. That vengeance may be seen today in the nervous, giggling, worldly minded and thoroughly carnal fundamentalism that is spreading over the land. Doctrinally, it wears the robes of scriptural belief, but beyond that it resembles the religion of Christ and His apostles not at all.\r\n<p>The mysterious presence of the Spirit is vitally necessary if we are to avoid the pitfalls of religion. As the fiery pillar led Israel through the wilderness, so the Spirit of truth must lead us all our journey through.

That is what He said; it only remains to learn by reverent comparison with other Scripture just what the words mean.\r\n<p>To insist that by these words Christ meant that He <i>never<i/> prayed for sinners would be to read into the words more than is there. We must remember that these words were spoken in a particular context; the great High Priest was appearing before the throne of mercy as Advocate and Intercessor and could at that time include in His prayers only those who were His own.\r\n<p>When a high priest of the Old Testament appeared before the mercy seat to offer blood for the sins of Israel, his intercessions extended to Israel only. They were the only ones for whom that atonement was made. They were the only ones who trusted in Him and looked to Him for help. Christ came in fulfillment of the Old Testament type, and it may safely be assumed that the prayer of John 17 was made only for those who accept Christ\'s atonement and avail themselves of the protection it affords.','Hebrews 7:25','Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.','Christ as our High Priest made the only sacrifice necessary for us.

Is it not reasonable that if Christ prayed for sinners once, He may be expected to pray for them again? Also we must remember that Jesus was a Son of man and frequently referred to Himself by that title. As such, He had and has a relationship to the whole human race. Is it thinkable that He would not pray for the race to which He belonged?\r\n<p>I realize that we are on holy ground right here, and common modesty would urge us to withhold any dogmatic judgments. But I believe that the question, Does our Lord pray for the unsaved? may be answered truthfully as follows: (1) As High Priest of His own redeemed people, Christ prays an efficacious prayer of intercession which avails only for those who trust Him as their Redeemer and Lord. This prayer is found in essence in John 17. (2) As Son of man and Savior, He prays for the lost world as well. Unless His prayers for the world were ascending to heaven, the judgment of God would not be withheld for a moment from the earth.','Luke 23:34','Jesus said, \'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\'','Amazing the love of Christ!

Our printing presses are constantly rolling out books crammed with useful information. Our schools are bulging with eager students bent on acquiring all possible knowledge in the shortest possible time. Among the most popular and lucrative radio programs on the air today are those designed to discover how many unrelated bits of information the participants possess. \"Who? What? When? Where?\" run the endless questions, and the impression is created that the one who can answer the greatest number is in some way a superior person.\r\n<p>It is vitally important that we make a sharp distinction between knowledge and truth — that is, between the knowledge that is but the sum of facts we possess and truth which is a moral and spiritual thing. It is possible to fill the mind with facts and be none the better for it, for facts have no moral or spiritual significance. Facts bear the same relation to truth that a corpse bears to a man. They serve as a medium whereby truth relates itself to outward life and circumstance but must depend for their significance upon the inner essence of truth.','John 16:13','But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth.  He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.','\"What is truth?\" that poignant question of Pilate (John 18:38).

Private ends are often sought by the aid of truth, ends that stand outside of and bear no relation whatever to truth itself.\r\n<p>If we were to observe strict accuracy, we should always capitalize the word Truth, for when we have pushed it back as far as we can, we will come to God Himself. For this reason, truth will always be the master, never the servant. And truth can never be understood apart from its moral and spiritual implications.','John 14:6','Jesus answered, \'I am the way and the truth and the life.

We are likely to be discouraged rather than inspired by the sight of a character too impeccable to be human. We draw more help from a man if we know that he is going through the fire along with the rest of us, and we may even take courage from the fact that he does not enjoy it any more than we do.\r\n<p>This may be the reason Christians have always felt a special affection for Simon Peter. We speak of Paul with solemn respect but of Peter with an understanding smile. When the doughty old fisherman is mentioned, the face of the ordinary struggling Christian lights up. Here is a man who is one of us, we say to ourselves. He had faults, but he conquered them and went on to become great in spite of them. He was no alabaster saint, faintly redolent of incense, gazing absently over our heads as we labor onward through the storm. He too knew the sting of the wind and the fury of the waves and, what is more to our comfort, he did not always acquit himself like a hero when he was in a tight spot. And that helps a lot when we are not doing too well ourselves.','Luke 22:31-32','\'Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.

Only Peter could solemnly swear that he would never desert Christ and then turn around and deny Him the first time he got in a tight place. Only Peter could fall at Jesus\' feet and acknowledge his own sinfulness and then rebuke his Lord for suggesting something with which he did not agree. The two natures that strove within him made him say and do things that appeared to be in direct contradiction to each other — and all within a matter of hours. Peter was a \"rock,\" yet he wavered, and so, I suppose, managed to become the only wavering rock in history. And he surely was the only man in the world who had faith enough to walk on water but not enough faith to continue to do so when the wind blew.\r\n<p>For better or for worse, that was Peter, and it took God a long time to unify his nature so that the strife within him ceased.

They are the fabrications of the Roman special pleaders who will make a case for themselves even if they must assassinate truth to do it.\r\n<p>Peter is, for instance, the only man in the world who was never married and yet had a mother-in-law; for the Bible says Peter\'s wife\'s mother lay sick of a fever, and Rome says he was not married. He was, according to legend, the first pope, yet Paul crowded him out of first place and eclipsed him easily. That first pope took a position of meek deference before Paul, a position so definitely below him that one wonders how things got that way. If Peter was pope and not Paul, why did the great official pronouncements issue from Paul and not from Peter? It is all very confusing, but not much more so than Peter himself.\r\n<p>Well, the good old man of God cannot be blamed for the position Rome has given him.

Should the contemplation of Peter\'s faults give aid and comfort to an impenitent heart, then that heart has only itself to blame. God never intended that we should hide our unconfessed sins behind the confessed faults of a saint. Peter\'s contrary nature drove him to God. Unless ours does the same, Peter will have lived in vain for us.\r\n<p>Anyway, we are glad Peter lived, and we are glad Christ found him. He is so much like so many of us, at least in his weaknesses.

The well-fed child grows larger each year; only the abdomen of the tiny famine victim grows, and that by a pathological distention that tells of approaching death.\r\n<p>In the realm of the spiritual, there is real danger that we may mistake unhealthy bloat for true growth. Paul dealt frankly with this danger and pointed out that being puffed up and being built up are two different things.\r\n<p>We all know how prone we are to find what we are looking for in the Scriptures and in our own lives. When appraising ourselves, we sometimes unconsciously adopt the technique of the defense attorney, that of playing up everything favorable to us and conversely playing down whatever would put us in an unfavorable light. While considering my own ministry, I have often caught myself magnifying every small victory out of all fair proportion and at the same time alibiing my failures and weaknesses. It is the old trick of seeing what we want to see and closing our eyes to the things we would rather forget. This is inflation, and unless it is judged and forsaken, it can result in a completely false estimate of our life and work.','First Corinthians 8:1','. . . We know that we all possess knowledge.

The man of faith is so sure of his position before God that he can quietly allow himself to be overlooked, discredited, deflated, without a tremor of anxiety. He is willing to wait out God\'s own good time and let the wisdom of the future judgment reveal his true size and worth. The man of unbelief dare not do this. He is so unsure of himself that he demands immediate and visible proof of his success. His deep unbelief must have the support of present judgment. He looks eagerly for evidence to assure him that he is indeed somebody. And of course this hunger for present approval throws him open to the temptation to inflate his work for the sake of appearances.\r\n<p>This need for external support for our sagging faith accounts for the introduction into religious activities of that welter of shoddy claptrap that has become the characteristic mark of modern Christianity. The church and the minister must make a showing, and nothing would seem to be ruled out that will add to the illusion of success. At the root of this is plain unbelief. Religious people are simply not willing to wait till the Lord comes to receive their reward. They demand it now, and they get it, a circumstance over which they will shed bitter tears in the day of Christ.','Second Corinthians 12:10','That is why, for Christ\'s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties.

That so-called Bible religion in our times is suffering rapid decline is so evident as to need no proof, but just what has brought about this decline is not so easy to discover. I can only say that I have observed one significant lack among evangelical Christians which might turn out to be the real cause of most of our spiritual troubles.

If the knowledge of Bible doctrine were any guarantee of godliness, this would without doubt be known in history as the age of sanctity. Instead, it may well be known as the age of the church\'s Babylonish captivity, or the age of worldliness, when the professed Bride of Christ allowed herself to be successfully courted by the fallen sons of men in unbelievable numbers.

Yet I for one cannot believe that the great surrender was negotiated by men of evil heart who set out deliberately to destroy the faith of our fathers. Many good and clean-living people have collaborated with the quislings who betrayed us. Why? The answer can only be, <i>from lack of spiritual vision.<i/> Something like a mist has settled over the church as \"the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations\" (Isaiah 25:7). Such a veil once descended upon Israel: \"For their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts\" (2 Corinthians 3:14-15). That was Israel\'s tragic hour.

He could not trust His work to blind men.','First Corinthians 2:4-5','My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit\'s power, so that your faith might not rest on men\'s wisdom, but on God\'s power.','Our great need in the church today is to see the <i>demonstration of the Spirit\'s power.<i/>  Then our faith can rest on God\'s power not on human wisdom, entertaining preaching and worship-team creativity.','Lord, raise up leaders who are God seers and grant to Your people once again the clear demonstration of Your Spirit\'s power.'),(886,'We Travel An Appointed Way','38','Could This Be Our Most Critical Need?',NULL,'From Spiritual Infancy to Maturity','Surely we need a baptism of clear seeing if we are to escape the fate of Israel (and of every other religious body in history that forsook God).

Unless they come soon, it will be too late for this generation. And if they do come, we will no doubt crucify a few of them in the name of our worldly orthodoxy. But the cross is always the harbinger of the resurrection.\r\n<p>Mere evangelism is not our present need. Evangelism does no more than extend religion, of whatever kind it may be. It gains acceptance for religion among larger numbers of people without giving much thought to the <i>quality<i/> of that religion.

Such as these need to hear the words of Christ, \"You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you\" (Acts 1:8). The only hope for a restricted heart is the mighty inworking of the Spirit. He can enlarge the mansion of the soul; but only He can do it.','Acts 1:8','But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.','Are we aware of the indwelling Spirit?

We appear to be waiting for some sweet chariot to swing low and carry us into the Big Rock Candy Mountain of religious experience.\r\n<p>Well, it is a pretty good rule that if everyone is saying something it is not likely to be true; or, if it has truth at the bottom, it has been so distorted by wrong emphasis as to have the effect of error in its practical outworking. And such, I believe, is much of the revival talk we hear today.\r\n<p>My reason for doubt of the soundness of it is that we appear to conceive of revival as a kind of benign miracle, a feverish renaissance of religious activity which will come upon us, leaving us morally just as we are now, except that we will be a lot happier and there will be a great many more of us. It\'s a good talking point and it has an aura of superior godliness about it; but the trouble is that it is just not true.','Psalm 85:6','Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?','Few of us have experienced <i>real<i/> revival and so our understanding of it is flawed.

We want to get the power of God into our hands, to call it to us that it may work for us in promoting and furthering our kind of Christianity. We want still to be in charge, guiding the chariot through the religious sky in the direction we want it to go, shouting \"Glory to God,\" it is true, but modestly accepting a share of the glory for ourselves in a nice inoffensive sort of way. We are calling on God to send fire on our altars, completely ignoring the fact that they are <i>our<i/> altars and not God\'s. And like the prophets of Baal we are working ourselves into a frenzy as if we could by violence command the arm of the Almighty.\r\n<p>The whole error results from a confused notion of revival and a failure to recognize the moral laws that underlie the kingdom of God. God never moves whimsically; His ways are never impulsive or erratic. He never sends judgment unless there has been a violation of His laws, nor does He send blessing apart from obedience to those laws. So precise are His movements both in justice and in mercy that an intelligent observer, aware of the circumstances, could predict with complete accuracy any visitation of judgment or grace God might send to a nation, a church or an individual.\r\n<p>Of this we may be certain: We cannot continue to ignore God\'s will as expressed in the Scriptures and expect to secure the aid of God\'s Spirit. God has given us a complete blueprint for the Church and He requires that we adhere to it 100 percent. Message, morals and methods are there, and we are under strict obligation to be faithful to all three. Today we have the strange phenomenon of a company of Christians solemnly protesting to heaven and earth the purity of their Bible creed, and at the same time following the unregenerate world in their methods and managing only with difficulty to keep their moral standards from sinking out of sight. Coldness, worldliness, pride, boasting, lying, misrepresenting, love of money, exhibitionism — all these things are practiced by professedly orthodox Christians, not in secret but in plain sight and often as a necessary part of the whole religious show.','Isaiah 57:15','For this is what the high and lofty One says — he who lives forever, whose name is holy; \'I live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.\'','God sets the conditions for revival.

There must be a return to the Lord <i>in practice<i/> before our prayers will be heard in heaven. We dare not continue to trouble God\'s way if we want Him to bless ours. Joshua sent his army up to conquer Ai, only to see them hurled back with bloody losses. He threw himself to the ground on his face before the Ark and complained to the Lord.\r\n	The LORD said to Joshua, \"Stand up! What are you doing down on your face? Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant . . . That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies . . . because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction\" (Joshua 7:10-12).\r\n<p>If we are foolish enough to do it, we may spend the new year vainly begging God to send revival, while we blindly overlook His requirements and continue to break His laws. Or we can begin now to obey and learn the blessedness of obedience. The Word of God is before us. We have only to read and do what is written there and revival is assured. It will come as naturally as the harvest comes after the plowing and the planting.\r\n<p>Yes, this could be the year the revival comes.

There is no abstract \"church\" which can be revivified apart from the men and women who compose it. The vague notion that there is somewhere a mysterious Body of Christ whose members are unknown, an invisible company upon whom the Holy Spirit can fall in answer to prayer, is a grand fallacy. It serves as a hiding place from reality to believe that such an unidentified superchurch actually exists apart from the plain ordinary people we see in our Christian gatherings and in our churches from week to week. But we may as well face the truth: Christians are people and people can be identified. They have names and faces and homes and friends and jobs. They keep house, go to school, drive trucks, buy, sell, travel, eat and bathe and sleep exactly as other people do. The seed of God is in them and their names are written in heaven, but they are not invisible. The world knows who the Christians are.','Acts 14:27','On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.','We don\'t go to church.

They were people. The names of some of them are listed by the Holy Spirit. Though it did not suit God\'s purpose to furnish us with a complete roster of every one present, those mentioned were certainly human enough. When the Spirit came on that memorable day He could only fall upon persons who were present, who could be identified, who were known to each other and to the community. There was no invisible body for Him to enter. He entered the bodies and souls of the men and women who were in that prayer meeting.\r\n<p>No church is any better or worse than the individual Christians who compose it. To look beyond the known members to some mysterious group which is imagined to be there, secretly prepared for a revival, is to err seriously in a province where error can be costly.','First Corinthians 6:19','Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? . . .','A church is spiritually revived only as the people who compose it are spiritually revived.

Whatever God may do for a church must be done in the single unit, the one certain man or woman. Some things can happen only to the isolated, single person; they cannot be experienced en masse. Statistics show, for instance, that 100 babies are born in a certain city on a given day. Yet the birth of each baby is for that baby a unique experience, an isolated, personal thing. Fifty people die in a plane crash; while they die together they die separately, one at a time, each one undergoing the act of death in a loneliness of soul as utter as if he alone had died. Both birth and death are experienced by the individual in a loneness as complete as if only that one person had ever known them.\r\n<p>Three thousand persons were converted at Pentecost, but each one met his sin and his Savior alone. The spiritual birth, like the natural one, is for each one a unique, separate experience shared in by no one. And so with that uprush of resurgent life we call revival. It can come to the individual only. Though a visitation of divine life reaches seventy five persons at once (as among the Moravian Brethren at Dusseldorf), yet it comes to each one singly. There can exist no collective body of believers that can be revived apart from the units that compose the body.\r\n<p>Understood aright these are truths full of great encouragement and good hope. Nothing can hinder you or me from experiencing the revival we need. It is a matter for God and the solitary heart. Nothing can prevent the spiritual rejuvenation of the soul that insists upon having it. Though that solitary man must live and walk among persons religiously dead, he may experience the great transformation as certainly and as quickly as if he were in the most spiritual church in the world.','Ephesians 3:17, 19','. . .

He will not be penalized for the failures of his fellow Christians, nor be asked to forego the blessing till his sleepy brethren catch up. God deals with the individual heart as exclusively as if only one existed.\r\n<p>If this should seem to be an unduly individualistic approach to revival, let it be remembered that religion is personal before it can be social. Every prophet, every reformer, every revivalist had to meet God alone before he could help the multitudes. The great leaders who went on to turn thousands to Christ had to begin with God and their own soul. The plain Christian of today must experience personal revival before he can hope to bring renewed spiritual life to his church.','John 7:37-39','. . .

Hunger is a pain. It is God\'s merciful provision, a divinely sent stimulus to propel us in the direction of food. If food-hunger is a pain, thirst, which is water-hunger, is a hundredfold worse, and the more critical the need becomes within the living organism the more acute the pain. It is nature\'s last drastic effort to rouse the imperiled life to seek to renew itself. A dead body feels no hunger and the dead soul knows not the pangs of holy desire. \"If you want God,\" said the old saint, \"you have already found Him.\" Our desire for fuller life is proof that some life must be there already. Our very dissatisfactions should encourage us, our yet unfulfilled aspirations should give us hope. \"What I aspired to be, and was not, comforts me,\" wrote Browning with true spiritual insight. The dead heart cannot aspire.','Matthew 5:6','Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.','Few of us seem to suffer from intensity of hunger and thirst for God.

The awe-inspiring power of a discharge of lightning may dissipate itself in the atmosphere and accomplish nothing, while a flashlight battery may provide illumination for a miner hours on end. One is a dramatic display of immense power without direction and the other a quiet application of modest energy to an intelligent purpose.\r\n<p>It is my conviction that much, very much, prayer for and talk about revival these days is wasted energy. Ignoring the confusion of figures, I might say that it is hunger that appears to have no object; it is dreamy wishing that is too weak to produce moral action. It is fanaticism on a high level for, according to John Wesley, \"a fanatic is one who seeks desired ends while ignoring the constituted means to reach those ends.\"','Psalm 107:9','For he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.','God satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.

Our error is that we try to secure these benefits by prayer <i>alone.<i/>\r\n<p>The correction of this error is extremely difficult for it entails more than a mere adjustment of our doctrinal beliefs; it strikes at the whole Adam-life and requires self-abnegation, humility and cross-carrying.

A man may throw himself on his face and sob out his troubles to the Lord and yet have no intention to obey the commandments of Christ. Strong emotion and tears may be no more than the outcropping of a vexed spirit, evidence of stubborn resistance to God\'s known will. Jacob wrestled against the angel through one whole night. It was only after he had been defeated that he became the aggressor and refused to let go of God. Why did Jacob resist so long? Because he was ashamed to confess his name to the angel.

Well, here are some suggestions which anyone can follow and which, I am convinced, will result in a wonderfully improved Christian life.\r\n<p>1. Get thoroughly dissatisfied with yourself. Complacency is the deadly enemy of spiritual progress. The contented soul is the stagnant soul. When speaking of earthly goods Paul could say, \"I have learned to be content\" (Philippians 4:11); but when referring to his spiritual life he testified, \"I press on toward the goal\" (3:14). \"So stir up the gift of God that is in thee\" (2 Timothy 1:6, KJV).\r\n<p>2. Set your face like a flint toward a sweeping transformation of your life. Timid experimenters are tagged for failure before they start. We must throw our whole soul into our desire for God. \"The kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it\" (Matthew 11:12).','Jeremiah 29:13','You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.','A holy dissatisfaction arises when we look in the mirror of God\'s Word.

Well, here are some suggestions which anyone can follow and which, I am convinced, will result in a wonderfully improved Christian life.\r\n. . .\r\n<p>3. Put yourself in the way of the blessing. It is a mistake to look for grace to visit us as a kind of benign magic, or to expect God\'s help to come as a windfall apart from conditions known and met. There are plainly marked paths which lead straight to the green pastures; let us walk in them. To desire revival, for instance, and at the same time to neglect prayer and devotion is to wish one way and walk another.\r\n<p>4. Do a thorough job of repenting. Do not hurry to get it over with. Hasty repentance means shallow spiritual experience and lack of certainty in the whole life. Let godly sorrow do her healing work. Until we allow the consciousness of sin to wound us, we will never develop a fear of evil. It is our wretched habit of tolerating sin that keeps us in our half-dead condition.\r\n<p>5. Make restitution whenever possible. If you owe a debt, pay it, or at least have a frank understanding with your creditor about your intention to pay, so your honesty will be above question. If you have quarreled with anyone, go as far as you can in an effort to achieve reconciliation. As fully as possible make the crooked things straight.','Matthew 3:8','Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.','Repentance and restitution result when we seriously reflect on what God shows us in His Word.

Bring your life into accord with the Sermon on the Mount and such other New Testament Scriptures as are designed to instruct us in the way of righteousness. An honest man with an open Bible and a pad and pencil is sure to find out what is wrong with him very quickly. I recommend that the self-examination be made on our knees, rising to obey God\'s commandments as they are revealed to us from the Word. There is nothing romantic or colorful about this plain, downright way of dealing with ourselves, but it gets the work done. Isaac\'s workmen did not look like heroic figures as they digged in the valley, but they got the wells open, and that was what they had set out to do.\r\n<p>7. Be serious-minded. You can well afford to see fewer comedy shows on TV. Unless you break away from the funny boys, every spiritual impression will continue to be lost to your heart, and that right in your own living room. The people of the world used to go to the movies to escape serious thinking about God and religion. You would not join them there, but you now enjoy spiritual communion with them in your own home. The devil\'s ideals, moral standards and mental attitudes are being accepted by you without your knowing it. And you wonder why you can make no progress in your Christian life. Your interior climate is not favorable to the growth of spiritual graces. There must be a radical change in your habits or there will not be any permanent improvement in your interior life.','Lamentations 3:40','Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD.','Personal revival will mean thoughtful personal application of God\'s Word and counter-culture living.

The jack-of-all-trades is the master of none. The Christian life requires that we be specialists. Too many projects use up time and energy without bringing us nearer to God.\r\n<p>If you will narrow your interests, God will enlarge your heart. \"Jesus only\" seems to the unconverted man to be the motto of death, but a great company of happy men and women can testify that it became to them a way into a world infinitely wider and richer than anything they had ever known before. Christ is the essence of all wisdom, beauty and virtue. To know Him in growing intimacy is to increase in appreciation of all things good and beautiful. The mansions of the heart will become larger when their doors are thrown open to Christ and closed against the world and sin. Try it.\r\n<p>9. Begin to witness. Find something to do for God and your fellow men. Refuse to rust out. Make yourself available to your pastor and do anything you are asked to do. Do not insist upon a place of leadership. Learn to obey. Take the low place until such time as God sees fit to set you in a higher one. Back your new intentions with your money and your gifts, such as they are.\r\n<p>10. Have faith in God. Begin to expect. Look up toward the throne where your Advocate sits at the right hand of God. All heaven is on your side. God will not disappoint you.\r\n<p>If you will follow these suggestions you will most surely experience revival in your own heart. And who can tell how far it may spread? God knows how desperately the church needs a spiritual resurrection. And it can only come through the revived individual.','Second Timothy 1:7','For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.','Implementation of change in personal habits and life patterns can be difficult when we are acting alone.

Such knowledge is not gained by assembling data but by sympathetic contact, by intuition, by meditation, by silence, by inspiration, by prayer and long communion.

In the English-speaking world of today we have available not only everything that has ever been written in our mother tongue, but everything that has ever been written in any language, done for us in English translation. In the face of such a mountain of books, memorizing on any wide scale will be seen to be altogether impossible.\r\n<p>The second thing is that excessive memorization kills the impulse to think independent thoughts and makes us into tape recording machines full of other men\'s words but without a vital idea of our own. It is my considered opinion that a book that has fed a great thought into my mind and inspired me to explore new ideas on my own has done vastly more for me than the book I have memorized from cover to cover.\r\n<p>My own method is to confine my memorization to the Scriptures and the great hymns. I memorize passages of Scripture so I can use them in my sermons and meditate on them as I travel.

John\'s vivid words are a sample:\r\n<p>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched — this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.

Notice how they expose us and locate us behind our disguises. The primary meaning of the word is <i>to eat,<i/> and from there it has been extended with rare honesty to cover most of the manifestations of an irritable disposition. \"To eat away; to gnaw; to chafe; to gall; to vex; to worry; to agitate; to wear away\"; so says Webster, and all who have felt the exhausting, corrosive effects of fretfulness know how accurately the description fits the facts.\r\n<p>Now, the grace of God in the human heart works to calm the agitation that normally accompanies life in such a world as ours. The Holy Spirit acts as a lubricant to reduce the friction to a minimum and to stop the fretting and chafing in their grosser phases. But for most of us the problem is not as simple as that. Fretfulness may be trimmed down to the ground and its roots remain alive deep within the soul, there growing and extending themselves all unsuspected, sending up their old poisonous shoots under other names and other appearances.','Psalm 37:1','Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong.','Fretfulness can rob us of the peace and joy of Christ.

We cannot close our minds to everything that is happening around us. We dare not rest at ease in Zion when the church is so desperately in need of spiritually sensitive men and women who can see her faults and try to call her back to the path of righteousness. The prophets and apostles of Bible times carried in their hearts such crushing burdens for God\'s wayward people that they could say, \"My tears have been my food day and night\" (Psalm 42:3), and \"Oh that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people\" (Jeremiah 9:1). These men were heavy with a true burden. What they felt was not vexation but acute concern for the honor of God and the souls of men.\r\n<p>By nature some persons fret easily.

No one ever has the right to commit an evil act, no matter how secret. God wills that men should be free, but not that they be free to commit sin.\r\n<p>Sin is three-dimensional and has consequences in three directions: toward God, toward self and toward society. It alienates from God, degrades self and injures others. Adam\'s is the classic example of a secret sin that overflowed to the injury of all mankind. History provides examples of persons so placed that their sins had wide and injurious effect upon their generation. Such men were Nero, Napoleon, Hitler and Stalin, to name but four.

And consider the thousands of little children who died of starvation because one man had a revengeful spirit; think of the millions of displaced persons who wander over the earth even today unable to locate mother or father or wife or child because men with hate in their hearts managed to get into places of power; think of the young men of almost every nation, sick with yearning for home and loved ones, who guard the empty wastes and keep watch on frozen hills in the far corners of the earth, all because one ruler is greedy, another ambitious; because one statesman is cowardly and another jealous.\r\n<p>To come down from the bloody plains of world events and look nearer home, how many wives will sob themselves to sleep tonight because of their husband\'s savage temper; how many helpless, bewildered, heartbroken children will cower in their dark bedrooms, sick with shock and terror as their parents curse and shout at each other in the next room. Is their quarrel private? Is it their own business when they fight like animals in the security of their home? No, it is the business of the whole human race. Children to the third and fourth generation in many parts of the world will be injured psychologically if not physically because a man and his wife sinned inside of four walls. No sin can be private.\r\n<p>Coming still closer, we Christians should know that our unchristian conduct cannot be kept in our own back yard.

If zeal indicates godliness, then these ardent devotees of error are saints of the first order, a notion that could hardly be entertained by anyone who knew them intimately.

They are ablaze with zeal, but they are nevertheless condemned on every page of the sacred Scriptures. Muslims pray oftener than the best Christians and are making converts to their faith in some parts of the world much faster than the followers of Jesus Christ.

The zeal that accompanies sanctity is rarely boisterous and noisy. So great was the zeal of our Lord that it was said to have eaten Him up, yet Isaiah said of Him: \"He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.\" And it was He who excoriated the zealots who compassed sea and land to find one convert, only to make him more evil than he was before.','Galatians 4:18','It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and not just when I am with you.','Emotional excitement does not necessarily express zeal.

The ardor that drives a man to his knees in intercession for others was found in men like Moses, Daniel and Ezra; but there is a kind of zeal that gives to the world such misshapen religious examples as Joseph Smith and Mary Baker Eddy.\r\n<p>That many Christians in our day are lukewarm and somnolent will not be denied by anyone with an anointed eye, but the cure is not to stir them up to a frenzy of activity.

What is true of philosophy is true also of religion. The faith of Christ was never intended to be an end in itself nor to serve instead of something else. In the minds of some teachers faith stands in lieu of moral conduct and every inquirer after God must take his choice between the two.

Without it life in a fallen world would be unbearable; without it the zest for living would disappear almost at once; without it one hour of adversity would break our spirits and drive millions to suicide. It is not too much to say that if all hope were destroyed within the human breast, the race of mankind would die out altogether in a very few years. Even the procreative drive and the instinct for self-preservation would hardly be strong enough to save from extinction a race from which all hope had fled.\r\n<p>Hope is a nurse and comforter and enables us to go on after every reason for going on has disappeared. Hope has sustained the spirit of a shipwrecked sailor and given him strength to stay alive through the long days that seemed years till help and rescue came; hope has steeled the patriot to fight on and win at last against overwhelming odds; hope has saved from insanity or suicide the prisoner in his lonely cell as he checked off the years and months and days on his homemade calendar; hope has enabled the sick or injured man to wait out the pain and the nausea till health returned and the suffering ended; hope has made light the feet of the traveler hurrying home in near exhaustion to the bedside of someone he loved.','Psalm 147:11','The LORD delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.','Despite the heavy burdens, hope strides ahead into the darkness with calm assurance of what lies beyond the clouds.

They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground (Hebrews 11:37-38).\r\n<p>That is a New Testament tribute to Old Testament saints; but the record of Christian times is fully as grim and sometimes worse.

His lovely little benediction pronounced over the Roman Christians shows how faith and peace and joy live with hope like four fair sisters dwelling in the same cottage: \"May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit\" (Romans 15:13).\r\n<p>Faith is confidence in the character of God, and hope is the sweet anticipation of desirable things promised but not yet realized. Hope is an electronic beam on which the Christian flies through wind and storm straight to his desired haven. To the child of God, hope is a gift from the heavenly Father \"who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope\" (2 Thessalonians 2:16).\r\n<p>The Christian\'s hope is sound because it is founded upon the character of God and the redeeming work of His Son Jesus Christ. For this reason Peter could call it \"a living hope\" (1 Peter 1:3). It is living because it rests on reality and not on fancy.

Why is hope thought to be both good and bad, both cheerful and deceitful? A little observation will show us why.\r\n<p>Hope has sustained the spirit of many a shipwrecked sailor by painting for him a tender picture of rescue and reunion with loved ones, only to leave him at last to die of thirst and exposure on the vast bosom of the sea. Hope has kept many a prisoner believing he could not hang, that a pardon would surely come, and then stood calmly by and watched him die at the end of a rope. Hope has cheered a thousand victims of cancer and tuberculosis with whispered promises of returning health who were never again to know one single day of health till they died. Hope has told the mother that her son missing in action was surely alive, and kept her watching till the end of her days for the letter that never came and that never could come because the boy that might have written it had long been sleeping in an unmarked grave on a foreign shore.\r\n<p>Surely for the fallen sons of men, the Hindu proverb is true: \"There is no disease like hope.\" Hope that has no guarantee of fulfillment is a false friend that comforts us a while with flattery and leaves us to our enemies.

Let a man approach the burning bush of divine truth with the desire to grasp it in his hand and the intensity of the fire will blind his eyes and cauterize his hands and face to the point of insensibility. Before the awesome vision of revealed truth, the human intellect should kneel and hide its face in trembling adoration. Because Moses was afraid to look upon God, the Lord could speak to him face to face as a man speaks to his friend; but God hides His face from the man who does not instinctively hide his own.\r\n<p>Intellectual pride, then, with its corollary, irreverence, is one cause of religious confusion. Satan\'s original doctrine, \"You will be like God, knowing . . .\" (Genesis 3:5) has been accepted by millions of religious persons through the centuries and commands a big following today even among professedly orthodox Christians. In spite of all Christ said while among men and all His inspired apostles wrote after His ascension, we seem never to learn that the inner essence of truth cannot be apprehended by the mental faculties. We still come at the awesome supernatural reality headfirst.','First Corinthians 2:13','This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.','Indispensable in uderstanding divine revelation is the ministry of the Holy Spirit.

They appear to be chagrined by the chuckles of the learned liberals at the allegedly ignorant fundamentalists and have been needled into an attempt to prove that we evangelicals are not so dumb after all. They hope to make their point by equating Christian theology with Greek philosophy and the findings of modern science, and demonstrating that if the truth were known the Christian revelation is just good clean reason, nothing more. I pass over the pretty obvious fact that there is in all this more than a trace of the taint of mind-worship.

I joyfully recognize that there is an outline of divine truth fitted to the human mind and intended by its Author to be received by it. I think no one can become a strong Christian who is not a theologian of some sort, but it is altogether possible to be a theologian and not be a Christian at all. Bible doctrine without love is but a shadow of truth; doctrine held in love is very truth indeed, and we dare not allow ourselves to be satisfied with anything less.\r\n<p>Another source of religious confusion is unbelief. The writer to the Hebrews attributed Israel\'s failure to benefit by the truth to a breakdown in their faith. \"But the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith\" (Hebrews 4:2). The thought of holding holy truth in unbelief is a frightening thing. For the unbelieving mind to tinker with the truth of God is as terrible as was the unauthorized act of Saul when in fear and unbelief he offered a burnt offering at Gilgal. \"I thought, `Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD\'s favor.\' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering\" (1 Samuel 13:12). So the king explained his act, but there is something spine-chilling about it all. An unholy man tried to do a holy act and tragedy followed. From that hour Saul\'s life degenerated till at last, deserted and terrified, he died by his own hand.','Hebrews 4:2','For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith.','There is truth we hold at arm\'s length.

It is addressed to the will, and the only proper response is obedience. We cannot possibly discharge our obligation to such a passage by trying in some dubious manner to \"believe\" it, though I am sure many try to do just that. Is it any wonder that confusion arises?\r\n<p>We will go far to simplify our religious concepts and unify our lives if we remember these four points: First, truth is a spiritual entity and can be grasped in its inner essence only as the Spirit of truth enlightens our hearts and teaches us in the deep, mysterious recesses of our souls. Secondly, since God is love we must surrender ourselves to love or we can never know the truth of God in its higher meaning. Thirdly, we must come to the Word with the simple faith of a child, ready to believe it whether we can understand it or not. And lastly, we must obey the truth as we see it, trusting God with the consequences.','Luke 8:21','He replied, \'My mother and brothers are those who hear God\'s word and put it into practice.\'','There is truth stated declaratively — we are to believe it.

These correspond to the lovers of high-brow music who firmly refuse to admit that there is anything of any real value other than that composed by Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. They know they are in the minority and glory in the fact, for in their opinion it is a very, very superior minority and they look down their noses at all who enjoy anything less complicated than a symphony.\r\n<p>Of course this is cultural snobbery and tells us a lot more about such persons than they would care to have us know.

The devotees of this doctrine appear to be more concerned with quantity than with quality. They seem burned up with desire to \"bring the people in\" even if they have not much to offer them after they are in. They take inexcusable liberties both with message and with method.

Should he go out for larger crowds or accept smaller ones as the will of God for him? Does success in the Lord\'s work depend upon numbers? Is it possible to make up in quantity what is lacking in quality and so accomplish the same result?\r\n<p>Perhaps an illustration or two might help. If our country should be visited by a famine and you were put in charge of feeding the starving in your section of the city, would numbers matter? Most surely they would. Would it not be better to feed five hungry children than two? Would you not feel obligated to feed hundreds rather than tens, thousands rather than hundreds? Certainly you would.

Since it was not acquired by reason operating on intellectual data, the possibility of error is eliminated.”\r\n<p>The letter comments on this as follows: “This statement seems to me to parallel the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal infallibility. I was always taught that the holy Scriptures are the only rule of faith and life. My observation has been that most of the false cults base their so-called doctrines and revelations on personal spiritual experience. I would appreciate your further clarification on this editorial statement . . . defining the boundaries with which `direct spiritual experience’ can be depended upon without danger of departure from the revealed Word of God as contained in the holy Scriptures and as projected in the earthly life of Christ.”\r\n<p>This matter deserves further explanation and I’ll be glad to make it.\r\n<p>In my editorial I said that there are three degrees of knowledge open to Christians. The first is the common knowledge shared with all normal persons, namely, the data furnished by the senses and by reason operating upon such data. This embraces all knowledge of natural things from the first scrap of knowledge enjoyed by an hour-old baby to the highest reaches of scientific information acquired by the pooled efforts of the race.\r\n<p>The second is the knowledge received by faith. It consists of data given by divine revelation and received by the believing mind without proof. It is taken on trust and cannot in the very nature of it be demonstrated as being true. Were proof possible then it would belong in the first category and faith would be unnecessary.\r\n<p>The third kind of knowledge is that given by direct spiritual experience. This differs radically from both of the others. It has nothing to do with the senses and so is not physical or natural data. It has nothing to do with ethics or doctrine and so is not moral or theological knowledge. I do not believe that God teaches doctrine by direct unmediated experience. The exact opposite is true. The Scriptures are the source of all rational knowledge about moral and religious things, except those things that are revealed by nature as mentioned in Psalm 19:1-4 and Romans 1:19-20, and they are few and inadequate.','First Corinthians 8:2','The man who thinks he knows something does not know as he ought to know.','There is <i>head<i/> knowledge, <i>head and heart<i/> and just <i>heart<i/> knowledge.

It is consciousness, it is acquaintance with something or someone by direct awareness. It might help the reader to understand what we mean by such words as “awareness” and “consciousness” if he were to ask himself how he knows he exists, how he knows he is himself and not someone else, how he knows he is alive and not dead. The answer is simply that he “knows” these things by conscious awareness of which reason is no part. Let him attempt to prove to himself that he exists, for instance, and he will find that the “he” who is doing the demonstrating must first be <i>aware<i/> that he exists before he can begin to prove that he does.\r\n<p>When the French philosopher, Descartes, sought to get to the root of all knowledge he thought away all accepted facts, went back till he found the one irreducible element of knowledge that could not be challenged and came up with his celebrated <i>Cogito, ergo sum,<i/> “I think, therefore I am.” But let no one imagine for a moment that with his little syllogism Descartes went all the way back. He did nothing of the kind. The truth is that he was by intuition aware of his existence before he ever began to notice that he was thinking. His self-knowledge antedated thought and all he did was to prove to reason that he existed by proof that it could understand: “I think, therefore I am.”\r\n<p>This illustrates but does not explain what we mean by religious knowledge by direct spiritual experience.

Soul-winning by persons who have not met the test of obedience to the Word of Christ must inevitably produce other professing Christians of the same spiritual stripe. Missions carried on by persons not spiritually endued can but transplant an effete Christianity on a foreign shore, for be sure that no church founded in a heathen land will be any better than the spiritual lives of those who founded it.\r\n<p>Real repentance will result in purified hearts and sanctified lives. A hard and determined return to the pattern shown us in the mount will bring the smile of God upon our efforts. Then we shall experience not less soul-winning, but more.

Materialism, pessimism, cynicism and skepticism were the four horsemen of those gloomy decades and they rode forth conquering and to conquer.\r\n<p>The scientists were materialistic, the philosophers skeptical, the novelists and biographers cynical and almost everyone pessimistic. Even the interpreters of prophecy were apprehensive, for they saw in the capture of Jerusalem by the British and the rise of the Roman Empire under Mussolini evidence of the nearness of the tribulation days, the coming of Antichrist and the collapse of civilization. About the only religionists on the Protestant side who managed to retain a little optimism were the liberals (“modernists” they were called in those days), and they were cheerful for a wrong reason. Out of the poetic passages of a Bible, in which they no longer believed, they wove delicate daisy chains, which have long since withered, and crocheted pretty religious doilies of which they are not now exactly proud and which they would willingly forget but cannot because their handiwork is still to be found among us — on the seventeen cent bargain table of the second-hand bookstores.','Ecclesiastes 1:2','\'Meaningless!  Meaningless!\' says the Teacher, \'Utterly meaningless!

It was a complete reversal. Religion came into its own. Faith became once more intellectually respectable and people stopped being ashamed to admit that they believed in God. Evangelicalism and the world wept briefly on each other’s shoulders, kissed, shook hands and became friends. The church discovered that she could use a good many of the world’s ideas and the world found that religion was a useful technique for achieving desired ends. The ox and the ass, as well as the lion and the lamb, romped together as they had not done since Luther nailed his theses on the door of the church at Wittenberg and launched the Reformation.\r\n<p>Over the last few years the world has gone on to woo the Church (about like water woos a duck!) and has won her heart and hand in what seems to be a case of true love. The honeymoon is still on and the church is now the pampered bride of the world. And what a dowry she has brought to her sensuous and drooling lover! An impenitent and unregenerate populace buys religious books by the millions, to the delight of the profit-hungry publishers. Movie stars now write our hymns; the holy name of Christ sounds out from the gaudy jukebox at the corner pool hall, and in all-night stomp sessions hysterical young people rock and roll to the glory of the Lord.\r\n<p>Today dark-browed Pessimism has gone out of vogue and her happy and responsible sister Optimism has come in to take her place. Christianity is now conceived as fun and the only cross is the one on which Jesus died several hundred years ago. Christ’s yoke is not only easy, it is downright thrilling. His burden is not only light, it is jaunty. The church goes along with everything and stands against nothing — until she is convinced that it is the safe and popular thing to do; then she passes her courageous resolutions and issues her world-shaking manifestoes — all in accord with the world’s newest social venture, whatever it may be.','Galatians 3:1','You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.','Though for different reasons, we are as foolish as the Galatians and bewitched. All is not well.

An ill-founded optimism may, under certain conditions, be extremely harmful. A Christian is not obliged to be either pessimistic or optimistic or glad or sad or positive or negative after a preconceived rule of philosophy. He should (and will if he is Spirit-taught) reflect the will of God in any given situation. His one concern is with God’s will. His one question in any set of circumstances is “What does God think of this?” To him nothing else matters. What the current popular attitude may be is of no importance to him. He will approve or disapprove altogether as the written Word and the indwelling Spirit indicate. Religious vogues, passing moods or popular notions will affect him not at all. His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.\r\n<p>This rather rigid attitude will, in a world like ours, quite naturally work against the one who holds it and earn him a reputation as a pessimist. People like the man who agrees with them, even if a day later they change their minds and require him to change his, too. This inconsistency they laugh off as an amiable weakness, and why be so pious about it anyway?\r\n<p>Well, the sons and daughters of eternity care very little about this maypole dance of popular favor. Like the water bird on the shore of the lake at the approach of winter, they feel within them a strong instinct to migrate. They expect before long to take off on a journey and they’re not coming back soon. So whether they leave behind them a reputation for pessimism or optimism is of little consequence to them.

That’s all that matters to them.','Colossians 3:2','Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.','Setting our minds on things above rather than on earthly things put us in tune with eternal reality.

The details are all unknown and undiscoverable, so that we must depend upon divine revelation as given in the holy Scriptures to fill in the particulars and render the picture intelligible.

Such persons demand to know, and though they neglect or reject the holy Scriptures they <i>will<i/> know, regardless, in some manner satisfying to themselves.\r\n<p>Bible lovers have been blamed for being excessively dogmatic and it may be that they sometimes are. I do not wish to justify a spirit of cocksureness wherever it may be found, but the certainty of the believer may be understood when it is remembered that it springs from his faith in the Scriptures as the full and true revelation of the mind of God to men. His dogmatism has back of it the strong “thus saith the Lord” of prophet and apostle. My own experience has taught me, however, that the most stubborn dogmatism is found not among those who quote the Bible to support their convictions, but among those who quote no one and claim for their spiritual authority nothing higher than their own opinions.','2 Corinthians 4:4','The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.','Satan, the great Blinder, has closed the minds of humankind through sin.

This follows the popular notion that everyone is capable of discovering for himself the true way to heaven and that one man’s belief is as good as another’s in any kind of weather. A second tenet in this creed is that no one has the right to question the belief of anyone else or to try to influence him in any way in religious matters. This leads naturally to the third tenet which is that we should practice complete tolerance toward every expression of religious belief, however base or ill-founded it may be, and accept it as someone’s way of worshiping God even if it isn’t ours.\r\n<p>All this has about it a certain savor of charity and slips well off the lips of politicians, who are forced to try to please everyone, and liberal ministers who find it profitable to do so. But the man who has knelt before the burning bush or heard the sound of thunder on the mount can never bring himself to sell out his soul in that manner. The man who has walked beside the sea and has heard the voice of Jesus saying “No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6), can ever get the consent of his heart thus to trifle with religion. He has been smitten with the love of God and the wonder of the cross and he can never again be tolerant in things that touch his soul and the souls of his fellow men. He will live beside, be patient with, minister to, pray for and love any religionist of whatever color or creed from a cardinal to a medicine man from the long grass, but never will he compromise the truth to stay on good terms with anyone.

No right-thinking person would try to deny this.\r\n<p>The whole scheme of rewards and punishment is a solid and substantial part of the belief of both Jews and Christians, as well as of many moral philosophers and of religions other than the Judeo-Christian. The human race at first was put on probation with the words, “but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die” (Genesis 2:17). This is truth so generally accepted by Christians everywhere as to call for no further comment here.\r\n<p>To live our lives reverently in the fear of God and in view of eternal consequences is right and good, <i>but to live our moral lives in fear of temporal consequences is an evil, a great and injurious evil for which not one shred of justification can be found.<i/> Yet the shadow of the fear of consequences lies dark across the church today and its blight is seen almost everywhere.','Second Corinthians 4:18','So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.

To obey Christ in one or two or ten instances and then in fear of consequences to back away and refuse to obey in another is to cloud our life with the suspicion that we are only fair-weather followers and not true believers at all. To obey when it costs us nothing and refuse when the results are costly is to convict ourselves of moral trifling and gross insincerity.','Second John 1:6','And this is love:  that we walk in obedience to his commands.  As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.','Obedience to God, whatever the cost, is nonnegotiable.  It is an expression of our faith, our trust in Him.

His only concern should be with the will of God and the moral quality of the proposed act. To consult anything else is to sin against his own soul.\r\n<p>Again, the pastor when facing his congregation on Sunday morning, dare not think of the effect his sermon may have on his job, his salary or his future relation to the church. Let him but worry about tomorrow and he becomes a hireling and no true shepherd of the sheep.

Whether or not we are conscious of doing so, we invariably add something to the truth as it enters (or take something away) to make it fit into the total body of ideas we hold and call “truth.”\r\n<p>To show how this works let us imagine two men reading the same passage of Scripture, one a Calvinist who has been brought up on Calvinistic theology from his youth, the other reared in the Arminian tradition and thoroughly indoctrinated in Arminianism. The passage they read is Hebrews 6:4-6, “It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened … if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance.” The impressions the Calvinist receives from these words will differ radically from those received by the Arminian, yet neither one will be conscious of adding to, subtracting from or otherwise altering the passage in any way. Each will understand the words to mean exactly what he has been taught that they mean. The meaning he sees there will appear to him so natural, so logical and right that he will wonder how anyone can see any other. (And sadly enough each will more than likely think the other a hypocrite who receives his teaching from the devil. But that is not pertinent to this particular argument.)','Acts 17:11','Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.','Surely respect is owed to those who faithfully teach us God\'s Word.

Even an apostle had to have a vision from heaven to free him from some of his old misconceptions and open his heart to a new order of truth (Acts 10:9-16). And we should remember that it does not take a perfect understanding of all truth to save a man and bring him into communion with God. Furthermore, God has sent us a Teacher in the person of the Holy Spirit (John 16:12-15).

They try to induce faith by baiting the seeker with Bible texts, all the while smiling and “helping” by voice and gesture. The whole performance, while undoubtedly well-intentioned, acts as a powerful suggestion to raise expectation and predispose the seeker’s mind to accept whatever the worker desires that it should. Then follows a series of questions and answers, the questions carefully put in such a way as to suggest the answers, ending usually with the familiar “Well, if He doesn’t cast you out, what does He do?” Of course there is only one answer to that question and the bewildered seeker gives it, “Why, He takes me in.” This brings on a burst of Amens, along with a great deal of backslapping and handshaking, and another convert has been made.

I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?” (John 3:8-12).\r\n<p>It is bordering on the irreverent to suggest that this sovereign work of the Spirit can be induced at the will of a personal worker by means of a textual recipe. The moment this is attempted, the Spirit withholds His illumination and leaves the worker and the seeker to their own designs. And the tragic consequences are all about us.\r\n<p>All any Christian worker can do is to point the inquirer to “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (1:29). That was all John the Baptist did. He did not attempt to create faith in any of his hearers. The Spirit alone can open the heart, as John well knew. It is our task to arrest the sinner’s attention, give him the message of the cross, urge him to receive it and meet its conditions. After that the seeker is on his own. The individual is out of the hands of the instructors and helpers and in the hands of the God with whom he has to do.','Acts 16:14','One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God.

This saves face and preserves our self-confidence, but it also mutes the voice of power in the gospel and weakens the operations of God in the soul. Only the despairing heart can know the inward witness.\r\n<p>In the final analysis, no one can lead another to God. All he can do is to lead the inquirer to the door of the kingdom and urge him onward. Between God and the returning soul there is a zone of obscurity through which he cannot see. It is the light that no man can approach unto and past which no one can go on his feet or by means of reason or theological knowledge.

It goes like this: “We are saved by accepting Christ, not by keeping His commandments. Christ kept the law for us, died for us and rose again for our justification, and so delivered us from all necessity to keep commandments. Is it not possible, then, to become a Christian by simple faith altogether apart from obedience?”\r\n<p>Many honest persons argue in this way, but their honesty cannot save their argument from being erroneous. Theirs is the teaching that has in the last fifty years emasculated the evangelical message and lowered the moral standards of the Church until they are almost indistinguishable from those of the world.

Insistence upon honoring but one side of the faith-obedience coin has wrought frightful harm in religious circles. Faith has been made everything and obedience nothing. The result among religious persons is moral weakness, spiritual blindness and a slow but constant drift away from New Testament Christianity.\r\n<p>Our Lord made it very plain that spiritual truth cannot be understood until the heart has made a full committal to it. “If anyone chooses to do God’s will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own” (John 7:17).

The man who, in order to get rid of the fear of black cats, must also rid himself of the fear of God is a victim of his own ignorance as surely as the man who nails a horseshoe over his door to bring good luck or carries a horse chestnut in his pocket to ward off an attack of the miseries. Neither man is acting rationally.\r\n<p>Superstition is a child of credulity and thrives on a diet of half-truths and error. It sneaks into the assembly of the saints as did the man without the wedding garment, and unless there is someone present with the gift of discernment, it manages to pass as a true child of faith.

Any notions we may have of God that have not been corrected and purified by the Word and the Spirit are likely to have some element of error in them, and the religious beliefs resulting from them will of necessity contain a certain amount of superstition.

The answer to these questions is not as pat as we could desire it to be. An unqualified <i>yes<i/> or <i>no<i/> would both be wrong. Here is the reason:\r\n<p>When we first come to God through Christ, we are pagans at heart and our ideas of God are likely to be a mixture of truth, half-truth, ignorance and error. Conversion lifts the veil of darkness in some measure from our minds and allows the light to shine in, but no one who is capable of self-analysis will deny that there still remains a great many shadowy images that have not yet come into clear focus. The newborn child knows God in the deeply spiritual meaning of the word <i>know<i/> as found in John 17:3, “Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.” But this intimate, vital knowledge does not immediately result in a perfect <i>conception<i/> of God. The mind may yet suffer from imperfect religious teaching, prejudices, mistaken judgments and faulty theological instruction; and in the exact measure that these things are present there will be unworthy and superstitious notions of God and spiritual things.\r\n<p>This kind of error is inevitable at first encounter with God. Let the Christian “follow on to know the LORD” (Hosea 6:3, KJV) and the margin of error will become narrower day by day and year by year as the body of truth becomes greater. So at any given moment in the Christian’s life, he may be entertaining imperfect or even unworthy ideas of the Deity, but the Spirit “working unseen like a miner in the depths of the earth” is laboring to purge away the error and fill the heart with pure and lofty notions of the Triune God. While this is going on the patient heavenly Father bears with our imperfection, “for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust” (Psalm 103:14).','Second Peter 3:18a','But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. . . .','None of us has a pure conception of God.

We manage to predict with reasonable exactness the actions of our friends in any given situation because we know what kind of persons they are. It is so with our ideas of God. Our notions of how God will act follow very closely our estimate of His character. God once complained through the psalmist, “You thought I was altogether like you” (Psalm 50:21). Superstition springs out of confusing God’s character with man’s, a kind of reversal of the original act of God in making man in His own image. Fallen men believe that God is very much like themselves and expect Him to act accordingly.\r\n<p>To be more explicit, men believe God to be whimsical, and consequently expect Him to be impulsive and unpredictable in His dealings with mankind. Out of this notion comes a score of superstitious fancies that have gotten themselves accepted through the years. Various fears originate here. Fear of black cats, omens, signs and magic numbers results from the ignoble idea that God is a kind of playful Puck who delights in practical jokes and Halloween tricks. The only defense against this is to know some word or sign that will protect the victim from the celestial prankster, hence the thousand and one marriage customs, funeral usages, and practices touching birth, death, travel, food, clothing, sleep, planting, harvesting, illness and almost every other phase of our life on earth.','2 Corinthians 3:18','And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord\'s glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.','There is the unconscious tendency on our part to form God into our image rather than rejoicing that He is transforming us into the image of Christ.

God is therefore subject in some measure to these evil powers and helpless against them unless we play along with the cruel game by staying off the thirteenth floor of hotels, looking at the new moon over our right shoulder, wearing a charm that has been blessed by a priest or reciting a religious phrase that is supposed to have some special power to terrify the devil. This is all unworthy of God and altogether beneath the dignity of the Majesty in the heavens.\r\n<p>Some persons also think of God as being vindictive, churlish and quick to take vengeance on anyone who is careless about words or gestures or customs, no matter how innocent he may be or how unintentional his error. Of course this is simply a case of judging God by ourselves and thinking that He is altogether such a one as we are. How utterly grateful we should be that when we sinned and fell away from grace in the beginning, God did not act like us. Our eternal hope lies in the fact that at that tragic hour God acted like Himself. His conduct sprang out of His own holy nature and led Him to send His only begotten Son to die for the very ones who had been guilty of such an awful affront to His Person.

There are thousands of little boys in Latin America who bear that name, and surely Satan does not stand in fear of them. No, it is not a combination of letters that strikes terror to the heart of Satan. It is the glorious Person who bears the name Jesus whom he fears.

And as the Presence lifts and withdraws, these symbols are brought in as poor substitutes.\r\n<p>The human heart must have something to love and fear.

Hardly anyone but has known remorse for his failure to express proper gratitude to father or mother or friend till it was too late. And most of us have felt the chill that comes to those who do acts of kindness for persons who receive them as matters of course without so much as a word of thanks. Even Christ appears to have suffered from such treatment, for after He had healed ten lepers and only one returned to give Him thanks, He asked rather sadly, “Where are the other nine?” (Luke 17:17). We dare not read too much into this, but it seems fair to assume that He wanted the cleansed lepers to thank Him, and was disappointed when they did not. But even here we must not conclude that these men were wholly thankless. They may quite easily have been grateful to friends and relatives, or even to total strangers who might have helped them in the past, and still have failed to express their thanks to the One who deserved it most.\r\n<p>This habit of thanking everyone but God is not confined to those nine lepers. Enter a plane, a train, a restaurant or any other place where modern civilized men and women meet and mingle and you will see evidences of the same spirit.

Somewhere I read of the Christian farm boy who went to college and who in the dining room always bowed his head to thank God before beginning to eat.

When the winter winds moaned through the trees and made the old house tremble, the old man would smile and say, “Ah! How good it is to have a warm place to sleep on a night like this.” And the mother would often speak of her large family, now grown and scattered: “How grateful I am that they are all healthy and all mentally sound. I am so thankful.” Their gratitude was genuine. Of that there could be no trace of a doubt, but I often wondered who was the recipient of it. Whom were they thanking? They never said.\r\n<p>The irreligious world has its own way of reacting. When things “break” fortunately for a businessman, an athlete or a politician he will slap his hands together and shout, “Great!

All were in black conspiracy to destroy the tender Man-child before He could offer Himself on an altar for the redemption of the world. From the natural viewpoint nothing could have been easier than to kill the Babe before He had learned to say “Father” or “Mother.” No bodyguard had He, and the very soldiers that should have protected Him were sent to murder Him. The quiet and harmless Joseph could not save Him from the cold ferocity of the dragon, nor could the sweet young mother afford Him shelter from the destructive power of an iron empire.

No slip of vegetable life has yet pushed up out of soil that was totally arid.

The real significance of the day stems from an event, a solid historical incident that took place on a certain day in a geographical location that can be identified on any good map of the world. It was first announced by the two men who stood beside the empty tomb and said simply, “He is not here; he has risen” (Matthew 28:6), and was later affirmed in the solemnly beautiful words of one who saw Him after His resurrection:\r\nBut Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him (1 Corinthians 15:20-23).\r\n<p>That is what Easter is about. The Man called Jesus is alive after having been publicly put to death by crucifixion. The Roman soldiers nailed Him to the cross and watched Him till the life had gone from Him. Then a responsible company of persons, headed by one Joseph of Arimathea, took the body down from the cross and laid it in a tomb, after which the Roman authorities sealed the tomb and set a watch before it to make sure the body would not be stolen away by zealous but misguided disciples. This last precaution was the brain child of the priests and the Pharisees, and how it backfired on them is known to the ages, for it went far to confirm the fact that the body was completely dead and that it could have gotten out of the tomb only by some miracle.','Romans 6:4','We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.','Because Christ rose from the dead there is hope beyond the grave for those who trust in Him.  But there is more!  We may experience His resurrection life <i>today!<i/>  Are we?','O Christ, You are risen from the dead and, as I trust You, the powr of sin is broken and new life is mine.'),(1020,'The Size of the Soul','43','What Easter Is About',NULL,'Resurrection Results','	In spite of the tomb and the watch and the seal, in spite of death itself, the Man who had been laid in the place of death walked out alive after three days. That is the simple historical fact attested by more than 500 trustworthy persons, among them being a man who is said by some scholars to have had one of the mightiest intellects of all time. That man of course was Saul, who later became a disciple of Jesus and was known as Paul the apostle. This is what the church has believed and celebrated throughout the centuries. . . .\r\n<p>Granted that this is all true, what does it or can it mean to us who live so far removed in space from the event and so far away in time? Several thousand miles and nearly two thousand years separate us from that first bright Easter morning. Apart from or in addition to the joy of returning spring and the sweet music and the sense of cheerfulness associated with the day, what practical significance does Easter have for us?\r\n<p>To borrow the words of Paul, “Much in every way!” (Romans 3:2). For one thing, any question about Christ’s death was forever cleared away by His resurrection. He “through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead” (Romans 1:4). Also His place in the intricate web of Old Testament prophecy was fully established when He arose. When He walked with the two discouraged disciples after His resurrection, He chided them for their unbelief and then asked, “ `Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?’ And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself” (Luke 24:26-27).\r\n<p>Then it should be remembered that He could not save us by the cross alone. He must rise from the dead to give validity to His finished work. A dead Christ would be as helpless as the ones He tried to save. He “was raised to life for our justification” (Romans 4:25), said Paul, and in so saying declared that our hope of righteousness depended upon our Lord’s ability to beat death and rise beyond its power.','Romans 4:25','He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.','Christ died for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.

Yet this is what the not-the-sin-question thing has taught the religious world to believe. This idea has been expanded, extended and illustrated in how many thousand sermons over the last fifty years till it has become part of the total belief of evangelical groups all over the world. I have personally heard earnest men tell their hearers that they need never fear being sent to hell because of their sins; that the only thing that could possibly condemn them is their failure to “accept” Christ. Thus the whole terrible sin question has been reduced to a theological technicality, and sin itself, that damning and destructive enemy of God and men, has been whitewashed and rendered tolerable, contrary to the whole spirit and mood of the Scriptures and to the beliefs of Christians since the days of the apostles.\r\n<p>Regardless of what men may say, we are still face to face with the sin question, and no man who has neglected to deal with his sins can even remotely understand the question of the deity of Christ and the mystery of the Godhead. Until the sinner has been brought before the bar of God and convicted of personal guilt, any notions he may have about Christ are bound to be academic, nothing more, and wholly unrelated to life.\r\nOne deadly result of our failure to face up to the fact of sin is the widespread moral insensitivity which characterizes Christians these days. Because there is only a Son question and not a sin question at all, there is little or no repentance required as a preparation for saving faith. The new convert accepts Christ and adopts a certain easy code — a bit above that of the irreligious world, to be sure, but infinitely below that of the New Testament. The nerve has died in the Christian conscience and the sin that would have driven our Christian fathers to their knees in a paroxysm of repentance leaves us almost untouched. It’s lots easier to shift the whole thing over to the “Son question” and escape the pains of repentance.

There is a difference. A prayer may be personal and still have no element of selfishness in it. The motive is everything. To be free from selfishness a prayer must be\r\n	(a) 	according to the will of God as that will is revealed in the Scriptures;\r\n	(b) 	for the honor of God rather than for the mere fulfillment of carnal ambition;\r\n	(c) 	made in unaffected love for God and men. Of course this rules out covetousness, competition and all evil desire.\r\n<p>A few Biblical examples of personal requests which were honored by the Lord are found in the prayers of Abraham, David, Hannah, the woman of Shunem, Jabez, Hezekiah, Ezekiel, the leper in Matthew 8, Bartimaeus and Paul.\r\n<p>QUESTION: <i>You warn against “using God” and “trying to employ Him to achieve our own ends.” Would not asking God for something personal be an attempt to “use” Him?<i/>\r\n<p>A truly spiritual man will be so united to Christ that he will have no desires apart from Him. If we Christians lived in the Spirit as perfectly as we should and could, our common interests would touch not only ourselves but the honor of God and the welfare of mankind as well. In answering a “personal” prayer God would then be helping the individual, blessing mankind and bringing glory to His own name all in one act. We need not hesitate to ask God to help us to achieve ends that lie in God. Our difficulty comes from asking Him to help us to reach ends that lie outside of Him.','Psalm 20:4','May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.','Before asking God to give us the desire of our heart, it is wise to ask Him to form the desire of hour heart according to His will.

I feel that I am not accomplishing anything worthwhile. Is it right for me to pray to be led into a different kind of work?<i/>\r\n<p>It is always right to take our problems to God in prayer. He has promised to bring the blind by a way that they knew not (Isa. 42:16), and He assures us that if we keep Him in our thoughts our path will be directed (Prov. 3:5,6). We should not, however, allow ourselves to get wrought up about anything. It is the consensus among superior souls (as revealed in their books of devotion) that the Spirit leads without agitation, while the enemy, when he tries to imitate the Spirit, usually whips us up to a state of confusion and mental distress. The best rule is to pray, trust God fully and then follow His providences. Do not insist upon an earthquake or a whirlwind as the only evidences of divine guidance. God may lead you by a still small voice or by quietly arranging a set of circumstances so ordinary as to seem commonplace. Faith accepts quiet guidance; only unbelief demands a miracle.\r\n<p>QUESTION: <i>I am a university student and my problem is this: If I study enough to pass my tests I have a feeling of guilt for having neglected my prayer life. If I pray enough to satisfy my heart I neglect my studies. What shall I do?<i/>\r\n<p>I think you are creating a problem where none exists. You have fallen into the common error of living a divided life, counting prayer as sacred and study as secular. God’s will never contradicts itself; neither does He lay upon us duties that conflict with one another.\r\n<p>Here is my advice: Consecrate your studies to God as a living sacrifice. Ask Him to accept your intellectual labors as an offering of love. To the spiritual man everything is sacred; nothing is secular. William Law says, “Miranda does not divide her duty between God, her neighbor and herself; but she considers all as due to God, and so does everything . . for His sake.”\r\n<p>Begin to think of your college work as intellectual worship acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. This will make the dullest subject enjoyable and, incidentally, it will sharpen your brain so you can grasp difficult ideas a lot more easily.\r\n<p>The notion that prayer is to be made in retirement only is erroneous. That prayer which consists of an address to the Deity (which the Pharisees made on the street corner and which our Lord said should be made in the closet) is only one kind of prayer. A well-lived life is a prayer if it is lived in the faith of Christ. The hands may pray by doing honest work, the feet by carrying us to that work; sleep can be prayer when it refreshes us to serve our fellow men and eating may be prayer if it is done with thanksgiving.\r\n<p>There is no reason to doubt that your college studies are an acceptable form of spiritual service. Of course, you should spend as much time as possible in prayerful retirement; only don’t get under bondage to it. “So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (1 Cor. 10:31).','First Corinthians 10:31','So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.','Doing <i>all<i/> for the glory of God is the essence of Spirit-filled living.

What can I do about this?<i/>\r\n<p>The fact that you mourn your lack of love is all in your favor. No one is likely to deplore the coldness of his heart unless there is some warmth there already. It takes love to desire love. There has scarcely been a Christian, however devout, who has not grieved because he loved Christ so little. This appears to be the one mark of saintliness that is almost universal.\r\n<p>Further, you must remember that your love for God is not primarily an emotion, but an act of the will. True Christian love is the love of willing, not the love of feeling, though it is likely to bring a great deal of joyous emotion along with it. Our Lord made the test of love to lie in obedience to His commandments (John 14:21-24). Feeling is a by-product of obedience. The order is:  (1) believing, (2) willing, (3) obeying, (4) feeling.\r\n<p>QUESTION: <i>My occupation is distasteful to me and God has not answered my prayer to have it changed. Can God be using it as a “thorn in my flesh” and refusing to hear my prayer for that reason?<i/>\r\n<p>This is extremely doubtful. Paul’s thorn was not his occupation, but something far more personal than that. God may be delaying the answer to your prayer because He knows that your trouble does not lie in your occupation, but in yourself.\r\n<p>It is a fallacy to believe that we are unhappy because of external circumstances, and that if we only get our circumstances straightened out we will become happy automatically. I once heard a great preacher say, “You’ll never be contented anywhere until you can be contented <i>anywhere,<i/>” and I agree with him fully. Peace of heart is a gift from God to the man who has met certain spiritual terms. It has nothing to do with occupation or living conditions. “My peace I leave with you” was spoken to persons who were to know little else but trouble for the rest of their lives.\r\n<p>God usually changes our circumstances by changing us internally. Allow Him to lift you above your present occupation and He may lead you into a better one.','Second Corinthians 5:7','We live by faith, not by sight.','Feelings are sometimes so contradictory.

King Herod made an unconditional promise to his stepdaughter Salome, and was compelled to fulfill it, though to do so cost him bitter remorse and forced him to commit a murder.\r\n<p>God, being sovereign (i.e., free to do what He wills to do), does not put Himself at the disposal of His creatures by making promises with no conditions attached. He never gets into a position where He must answer prayer against His will. Certain extremists, to encourage faith, teach that God has made a unilateral covenant from which He cannot escape, and all we need to do is to believe to assure our getting anything we want. Such teaching is in radical contradiction to the letter as well as the spirit of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n<p>Paul’s thorn presents a tough problem for the Bible teacher; but if we do not know what it means we may at least know what it does not mean; and it does not mean that in refusing to remove the thorn in answer to prayer God became guilty of a breach of promise. “Let God be true, but every man a liar.” “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?”\r\n<p>God answered Paul’s prayer by granting him grace instead of deliverance, and Paul was well content. Isn’t it odd that the apostle who was directly and intimately concerned in the matter should be so very happy about the whole thing and we who are not in any way affected should be the ones to complain about it!','Second Corinthians 12:8-9','Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.  But he said to me, \'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\'  Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ\'s power may rest on me.','Paul wanted the thorn removed.

Confidence under such conditions would be sheer presumption. On the other hand, when He has made His will plain to us, why should we fear to say “Thy will be done”? The only valid prayer is that made in the will of God, either to know that will or because we know it. Until we know it we do well to cover our ignorance with the blanket of meek submission.\r\n<p>True prayer is not an effort to persuade God to do our will; it is rather an effort to move into the powerful will of God so as to be swept along by it. The man who loves and understands the will of God will not want anything outside of it.\r\n<p>Our hesitancy to add “Thy will be done” to our prayers could arise from an honest fear lest we make the words a hiding place for unbelief; or it could reveal an unconscious determination to get what we want whether God wills it or not.\r\n<p>When I hear a preacher condemn the practice of ending our prayers with the words “Thy will be done” I have an uneasy feeling that he may be unintentionally upbraiding the One who once used those words in the Garden of Gethsemane.

Some brands of Christianity will tell you very quickly that they are just trying to do a little bit of good on behalf of neglected people and neglected causes. Others will affirm that we can do more good by joining in the “contemporary dialogue” than by continuing to proclaim the “old, old story of the cross.”\r\n<p>But we stand with the early Christian apostles. We believe that every Christian proclamation should be to the glory and the praise of the One whom God raised up after He had loosed the pains of death. I am happy to be identified with Peter and his message at Pentecost:\r\nJesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man was handed over to you by God’s set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him (Acts 2:22-24).\r\n<p>Peter considered it important to affirm that the risen Christ is now exalted at the right hand of God. He said that fact was the reason for the coming of the Holy Spirit. Frankly, I am too busy serving Jesus to spend my time and energy engaging in contemporary dialogue.','Ephesians 1:19b-20','That power is like the working of his mighty strength, which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms.','In this post September 11 period there is the tendency for us to deemphasize the unique Godness of the risen Christ who is exalted at the Father\'s right hand.

And that we have One of our own representing us there.\r\n<p>That is what the early church was excited about. And I think our Lord may have reason to ask why we are no longer very excited about it. The Christian church in the first century was ablaze with this concept of the risen and victorious Christ exalted at the right hand of the Father. Although it worshipped no other man, it urged the worship of this glorified and exalted Man as God, because He had always been the eternal Son, the second Person of the Godhead. Paul wrote to Timothy:\r\n<p>There is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men — the testimony given in its proper time (1 Timothy 2:5-6).','1 Timothy 2:5-6','For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men — the testimony given in its proper time.','Jesus Christ qualifies as our Mediator with God because Christ gave Himself as a ransom for us all.

Why should we ignore the reality of such a priesthood and treat it as if it was some appendage to religious forms and traditions?\r\n<p>The true idea of the priesthood, as it was developed in the Old Testament and fulfilled by our Lord Jesus Christ, was ordained by God. It came from His mind and heart. It was dimly foreshadowed in the lives of praying fathers, heads of their households, who assumed responsibility and concern for their families.\r\n<p>Job was a good example of this kind of Old Testament family priest. Afraid his children might have sinned, he prayed to God,  asking Him to forgive and cleanse them. But the concept is much more clearly embodied in the Levitical priesthood, ordained by God for Israel’s forgiveness and cleansing. In its final perfection, the priesthood is portrayed in Jesus Christ, our Lord.\r\n<p>We must acknowledge that God’s concept of the priesthood arose from man’s alienation from God. It is based on the fact that man has strayed from God and is lost. This is a fundamental part of truth, just as surely as hydrogen is a part of water. You can not have water without hydrogen. Just as surely, you cannot have Bible truth without the teaching that mankind has broken with God and fallen from his first created estate, where he was made in God’s image.','1 Peter 2:4-5','As you come to him, the living Stone — rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him — you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.','As believers we are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices.

When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. But God gives it a body as he has determined. . . .\r\nSo will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body . . .  Just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we  bear the likeness of the man from heaven. . . . \r\nWhen the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: \'Death has been swallowed up in victory\' (1 Corinthians 15:36&#150;38, 42&#150;44, 49, 54).\r\n<p>Surely it was this same revelation by the Spirit of God that caused the writer Jude to exclaim:\r\nTo him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy — to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore!

But God in love and wisdom came once more. He came to speak, revealing Himself this time through His eternal Son. It is because of the coming of Jesus into the world that we now look back on the revelation in the Old Testament as fragmentary and incomplete. We could say that the Old Testament is like a house without doors and windows. Not until the carpenters cut in doors and windows can that house become a worthy, satisfying residence.\r\n<p>Years ago my family and I enjoyed Christian fellowship with a Jewish medical doctor who had come to personal faith in Jesus, the Savior and Messiah.

Hebrews lets us know that while our Christian faith surely was foreshadowed in and grew out of Judaism, it was not and is not dependent on Judaism. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ, spoken while He was here on earth, still speak to us with spiritual authority. At one time He reminded His disciples that new wine must never be put in old, unelastic wineskins. The parable was patent: the old religious forms and traditions could never contain the new wine He was introducing.\r\n<p>He was saying that a fixed gulf exists between vital Christianity and the old forms of Judaism.

But just as the child progresses to maturity and independence, so the Christian faith and the Christian evangel were independent of Judaism.

It points in the same direction, though using different ways and different means and different persons.\r\n<p>Begin in Genesis and continue through the Old and New Testaments and you will perceive the uniformity.

By \"bring[ing] all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, even Christ.\" If we will give the Scriptures attention, we will learn from them that a great future day is coming in which God will prove the essential unity of His creation. That spectacular display will be correlated and fulfilled in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ. God will make it plain that all things have derived their form from Christ; they have received their meaning by the power of His word; and they have maintained their place and order through Him. \r\n<p>Jesus Christ is God creating.

We do not see the \"spirits of righteous men made perfect\" (Hebrews 12:23) or the beckoning row-on-row of principalities or the shining ranks of powers throughout the universe. In this time of our incompleteness, we do not comprehend the glory that will be ours in that future day when leaning on the arm of our heavenly Bridegroom we are led into the presence of the Father in heaven with exceeding joy.','Hebrews 1:14','Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?','Much more alerted are we to what may be evil forces and influences about us than we are to the hand of God.

Everything has been ordered, created and laid out so that it becomes the garment of Deity or the universal living expression of Himself to the world.\r\n<p>When we read that God has appointed Jesus, the Son, to be the heir of all things, the reference is to the whole creation of God as it will be seen in its future, ultimate perfection.

In that great coming day of consummation, the children of God&#151;the believing family of God&#151;will experience a blessed harmony and communion of the Spirit. I surely agree with the foresight of the English poet, John Brighton, who caught a glimpse of a coming day of fellowship among the people of God. He wrote:\r\nIn one eternal bond of love, One fellowship of mind, The saints below and saints above Their bliss and glory find.\r\n<p>I believe that is scriptural.

Because we believe them, we believe and confess that Jesus was very God of very God.\r\n<p>Nothing anywhere in this vast, complex world is as beautiful and as compelling as the record of the Incarnation, the act by which God was made flesh to dwell among us in our own human history. This Jesus, the Christ of God, who made the universe and who sustains all things by his powerful word, was a tiny babe among us. He was comforted to sleep when He whimpered in His mother’s arms. Great, indeed, is the mystery of godliness.\r\n<p>Yet, in this context, some things strange and tragic have been happening in recent years within Christianity. For one, some ministers have advised their congregations not to be greatly concerned if theologians dispute the virgin birth of Jesus. The issue, they say, is not important. For another thing, some professing Christians are saying they do not want to be pinned down as to what they really believe about the uniqueness and reality of the deity of Jesus, the Christ.','John 1:18','No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father\'s side, has made him known.','Jesus Christ is Himself God.

Such a believer lives with calm and confident assurance that Jesus Christ is truly God and that He is everything the inspired writer said He is. He is \"the radiance of God\'s glory and the exact representation of his being.\" This view of Christ in Hebrews harmonizes with and supports what Paul said of Jesus when he described Him as \"the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation\" (Colossians 1:15), in whom \"all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form\" (2:9).\r\n<p>Bible-believing Christians stand together on this. They may have differing opinions about the mode of baptism, church polity or the return of the Lord. But they agree on the deity of the eternal Son. Jesus Christ is of one substance with the Father&#151;begotten, not created (Nicene Creed). In our defense of this truth we must be very careful and very bold — belligerent, if need be.\r\n<p>The more we study the words of our Lord Jesus Christ when He lived on earth among us, the more certain we are about who He is. Some critics have protested, \"Jesus did not claim to be God, you know. He only said He was the Son of Man.\"\r\n<p>It is true that Jesus used the term Son of Man frequently. If I can say it reverently, He seemed proud or at least delighted that He was a man, the Son of man. But He testified boldly, even among those who were His sworn enemies, that He was God.

His true glory is that which causes the heavenly beings to cover their faces in His presence. It brings forth their worshipful praise: \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts!\" The glory of the Lord is that forth-shining that gives Him universal praise.

The preacher who reported his guardian angel had had a hard time keeping up with him as he sped over the highway spoke in bad taste and probably in ignorance. If that is the best a preacher can say about the guardian angels or God\'s angelic host, he needs to go back to his Bible.','Hebrews 1:14','Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?','Angels depicted with huge wings has contributed to the lessened attention we give them these days.

It should be of great significance to us, then, that the writer would assure them that Jesus our Lord is infinitely above and superior to the brightest angels who inhabit the kingdom of God. Never has there been a created angelic being of whom it could be said, as it was said of Christ, He is \"the radiance of God\'s glory and the exact representation of his being\" (1:3).','Hebrews 1:5','For to which of the angels did God ever say, \'You are my Son; today I have become your Father\'?

We choose to read what we like. We neglect those portions that seem to have less interest for us.

Our Roman Catholic neighbors in their hymnody and teaching have given considerable recognition to the holy angels. Protestants seem to have reacted in a reverse way. It is as though we have decided to say nothing at all about the angels.\r\n<p>In Old Testament times and in the early Christian church, there were churchmen and scholars who gave much attention to matters relating to angelic hosts and their appearance. When Paul spoke of the creation to the Colossians, he mentioned both the visible and the invisible world, naming thrones, powers, rulers, authorities (Colossians 1:16). Often these have been perceived of as ranks or degrees of angelic beings and their authority and power.','Psalm 91:9&#150;11','If you make the Most High your dwelling&#151;even the LORD, who is my refuge&#151;then no harm will befall you, . . .

But we will not become angels in the life to come, contrary to what some have believed since childhood. God makes it clear that we do not change from one species to another.

Jesus Himself spoke of \"legions\" of angels. \"Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?\" (Matthew 26:53). The writer to the Hebrews refers to their number as \"thousands upon thousands\" (Hebrews 12:22). And David the psalmist refers to \"the chariots of God\" as numbering \"tens of thousands and thousands of thousands\" (Psalm 68:17). No one is able to answer conclusively why God made the heavenly host so numerous.\r\n<p>Going back into the Old Testament, we note that angels apparently had some function at the creation. In His conversation with Job, God spoke of laying earth\'s \"cornerstone\" and remarked that \"all the angels shouted for joy\" (Job 38:7). Angels figured in the giving of the Law at Sinai. \"The law,\" wrote the apostle Paul, \"was put into effect through angels by a mediator\" (Galatians 3:19).\r\n<p>An angel&#151;Gabriel by name&#151;appeared to the virgin Mary with the announcement that she would give birth to a Son whom she was to name Jesus (Luke 1:26&#150;31). In telling the story of Lazarus, the destitute beggar, Jesus declared that \"angels carried him to Abraham\'s side\" (Luke 16:22). It is a picture almost reminiscent of the \"ticker tape\" parades welcoming our nation’s heroes. That righteous beggar was escorted into the precincts of heaven with the angels leading the procession. I am convinced that the angels of God have a large role in preserving the righteous.','Revelation 19:9&#150;10','Then the angel said to me . . . At this I fell at his feet to worship him.

When He had prayed to the point of exhaustion as He faced betrayal and the coming crucifixion, \"an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him\" (Luke 22:43).\r\n<p>At Jesus\' resurrection, angels were much in evidence.

On that day we will discover that the ministries of the angelic beings are indeed practical and very real.\r\n<p>Now, you probably are wondering how much personal experience I have had with angelic beings. \"Have I ever seen an angel?\"\r\n<p>I have never seen an angel. Nor have I ever claimed to be a visionary person. My calling has been to pray and study and to try to find from the Scriptures what God is doing and what He has promised to do. I proclaim the teaching of the Scriptures that the angels of God are busy in their special ministries. I base that observation on the Word of God, not upon any facet of my own human experience.\r\n<p>The Bible does not tell any of us to spend our time trying to get in touch with angels. It does tell us that angels exist and that they are busy. Their activity is frequently mentioned in the Scriptures. I am not going to skip over those references, ignoring them, as some do.\r\n<p>At times we talk about the providential care of God without really knowing what we say and what we mean. Some Christians testify to \"coincidences\" in their lives&#151;perhaps two very important things occurring at just the right time and place. Hundreds of years ago Thomas Aquinas wrote to the Christian church, saying, \"The function of God\'s angels is to execute the plan of divine providence, even in earthly things.\" Then John Calvin followed with his teaching that \"angels are the dispensers and administrators of the divine beneficence toward us.\"','Acts 10:4&#150;5','Cornelius stared at him in fear.  \'What is it, Lord?\' he asked.

After I had found the Lord as a youth, I was attending a church that seemed to be of very little spiritual help to me. Actually, it was the kind of church in which it would be easy to backslide. One Sunday morning I awoke in a bad mood. \"I am not going to church today!\" I decided. So I went for a walk in the country. I did not have any golf clubs to use as an excuse. Neither did I tell the Lord I was going to worship amid the beauties of nature. I knew within myself that I really was backsliding&#151;going in the wrong direction that Sunday morning.\r\n<p>I turned aside to walk through a grassy field. In the middle of the field my foot suddenly kicked something hidden in the grass&#151;something red. I stooped and picked up an old red-bound book. It looked as if it had been in the rain, had dried out, had been rained on again and dried out again. The book was not some old literary classic. It was not a discarded book of cheap fiction. It was a Christian handbook: a thousand questions and answers for anyone interested in Bible study.\r\n<p>I opened it. And after I had scanned a few pages of biblical teaching, I became impressed by the fact that I should have been in church with other believers that morning. I threw the book back on the ground and started for home, wondering who had put such a message directly in the way of a discouraged Christian boy who was too gloomy to go to church.\r\n<p>I am not saying that the book was placed there by an angel or some other heavenly visitor in just the right spot. In all likelihood it was dropped in that place by someone who had chanced to pass through the field. But in the providence of God it was that day the reminder I needed of the goodness and faithfulness of God in my life.','Acts 12:7','Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. \'Quick, get up!\' he said, and the chains fell off Peter\'s wrists.','All of us can recall God\'s gracious interventions and provisions at significant points in life.

I would spend weekends \"riding the rods.\" I had little money, and I would hitch free rides on the freight trains, riding the rods under the boxcars.\r\n<p>The Lord chose a particular Sunday to teach me the lesson I had to learn. I do not remember now which town was involved, but <i>I<i/> was involved and so was the Lord. The freight train slowed down, then braked to a stop. The car that I was riding halted directly alongside a church yard. The train had hardly stopped when the church bells began to ring.

I do not know if they were Methodist or Presbyterian or Anglican church bells. But they reminded me that I should not be riding freight trains. Rather, I should be back where I belonged. And, believe me, very soon I was back where I belonged&#151;and straightened out spiritually, too!\r\n<p>How was all of that arranged? The right day, the right hour, the right place. If I had walked up to the engineer to inquire if he was an angel, he probably would have smiled, spit some tobacco juice over the cab window sill and replied, \"Not that I know of!\" But this I am sure of: when that engineer put on those brakes, it was by the providence of God that I would be halted practically in a church yard, with the bells pleading, \"Go back, young man!

My heart has been warm ever since with that thought. God has sent His Word throughout all of the earth to save me. You may be critical if you wish. Do with that text as you will. You may even have some theological problem with it.

Cannot God do anything He wants to do? No one would have questioned His works as the works of deity. But Jesus veiled His deity and ministered as a man. It is noteworthy, however, that He did not begin His ministry&#151;His deeds of authority and power&#151;until He had been anointed with the Holy Spirit.\r\n<p>I know there are erudite scholars and theological experts who will dispute my conclusion. Nevertheless, I hold it true. Jesus Christ, in the power and authority of His Spirit-anointed humanity, stilled the waves, quieted the winds, healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, exercised complete authority over demons and raised the dead. He did all the miraculous things He was moved to do among men not as God, which would not have been miraculous at all, but as a Spirit-anointed man. Remarkable!\r\n<p>This is why I say that Jesus Christ has taken away our human excuses forever. He limited Himself to the same power available to any one of us, the power of the Holy Spirit.

He could be anointed to that extent!\r\n<p>Going back into the Levitical priesthood, we discover a ritual of an anointing with a specially prepared holy oil. Certain pungent herbs were beaten into the oil, making it fragrant and aromatic. It was unique; Israel might not use that formula for any other oil. When a priest was set apart and anointed, the oil was a vivid type of the New Testament anointing of the Holy Spirit. The holy anointing oil could only be used for the anointing of men with special ministries&#151;priests, as I have indicated, and kings and prophets. It was not intended for the carnal, sinful person.\r\n<p>In Leviticus we read of the consecration of Aaron as the first high priest. The anointing oil and the blood from the altar are mentioned together: \"Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments. . . .

They believe Jesus was a man while He was here on earth, but they tend to believe that He is a spirit now.','1 Timothy 2:5','For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men — the testimony given in its proper time.','Writing after Christ\'s resurrection and ascension, Paul refers to Christ Jesus as a <i>man.<i/> Having taken on humanity, Christ continues to be the God Man.

He invited Thomas to feel the wound marks in His flesh. What blessed meaning there is in His words to the fearful disciples: \"Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have\" (Luke 24:39). Whether modern men and women agree on the exaltation of the Man Christ Jesus, we in the family of God have heard His words and we know the New Testament witness: \"God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear\" (Acts 2:32&#150;33).\r\n<p>The apostle Paul told Timothy, \"There is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men\" (1 Timothy 2:5). This should be counted as a great victory for Christian believers in our day. Jesus is a Man and He is enthroned at God\'s right hand. That is significant!','Hebrews 7:24&#150;25','But because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.','Not only did Christ die for our sins, He rose again and <i>always lives to intercede for us.<i/> We have a mighty mediator!','O Lord, You not only save completely, You live to intercede for me.

He is a victorious man, and if we are in Him, we too can be victorious.\r\n<p>Through the new birth, the miracle of regeneration, we have been brought by faith into the kingdom of God. As Christians we should recognize that our nature has been joined to God\'s nature in the mystery of the incarnation. Jesus has done everything He can to make His unbelieving people see that we have the same place in the heart of God that He Himself has. He does so not because we are worthy of it, but because He is worthy and He is the Head of the Church. He is the representative Man before God, representing us.\r\n<p>Jesus is the Model Man after which we are patterned in our Christian faith and fellowship. That is why He will not let us alone. He is determined that we will have eyes to see more than this world around us. He is determined that we will have eyes of faith to see God in the kingdom of heaven, and Himself&#151;our Man in glory&#151;seated there in victorious control!','Second Corinthians 3:18','And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord\'s glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.','One day we shall be like Him for we shall see Him as He is (1 John 3:2).

I thought I could do what I promised you, but I find it is not humanly possible.\"\r\n<p>That is the language and the experience of human beings. Quite the opposite is our experience when we relate with God. All of God\'s promises are sure. They are as reliable as His character. Here is how the writer of the letter to the Hebrews puts it:\r\nWhen God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself, saying, \'I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.\' And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised (Hebrews 6:13&#150;15).\r\n<p>I must confess that in my ministry I keep repeating some of the things I know about God and His faithful promises. Why do I insist that all Christians should know for themselves the kind of God they love and serve? It is because all the promises of God rest completely upon His character.','Hebrews 11:11','By faith Abraham, even though he was past age&#151;and Sarah herself was barren&#151;was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise.','We learn to judge promises largely on the basis of who is making them whether politician, salesperson, close friend or family member.

Those to whom it is primarily written were being persecuted. They were suffering. The enemy of their souls was busy planting doubts about God\'s plans for them and God\'s promises to them. Probably Satan was sowing doubts about the very character of God who had revealed Himself in a new covenant of grace, sealed in the blood of Jesus, the Lamb of God.\r\n<p>Let me share a conclusion I have come to in my study of the Scriptures. I have come to believe that all the promises of God have been made to assure us weak and changeable humans of God’s never-ending good will and concern. What God is today He will be tomorrow. And all that God does will always be in accord with all that God is!','Psalm 84:12','O LORD Almighty, blessed is the man who trusts in you.','God is the same today, yesterday and forever.

I do not know how familiar you are with the ways of God and the tender movings of His Spirit. But I will tell you this quite frankly: God does not play on our emotions to bring us to the point of spiritual decision.','Job 24:22-23','But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life.

When in our Christian experience our emotions are raised, it must be the result of what God\'s truth is doing for us. If that is not so, it is not properly religious stirring at all.','Acts 10:44','While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.','We have all been in services when those in charge resorted to emotional manipulation.

The Bible is frank, logical, honest. Certain things are true, the Bible is saying, and here they are. And because those things are true, these are your obligations. That is the way God has seen fit to work in His communication with the men and women of this planet.\r\n<p>In the past, there have been those who have looked at what the Bible has to say, and they have reasoned like this: \"No argument. Christ carries the supreme authority of God. That leaves us no room to be concerned, no reason to be disturbed. Everything is in God\'s hands!\"\r\n<p>But God\'s Word declares that it is not quite that simple. God has made everyone of us with a free will. He has made us capable of choosing or rejecting. For us to ignore the authority that God has given to His Son is a grave offense, indeed.','Matthew 28:18','Then Jesus came to them and said, \'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\'','All authority in Heaven and on earth belongs to Christ.

A promise&#151;any promises&#151;nothing in and of itself. The value of the promise depends on the character of the one who makes it. We know only too well the history of men and women.

I believe God made an accommodation and went along with our way of doing things. When during Abraham\'s time He made a promise to save His people, God took an oath to confirm the covenant. And because He could call on no one greater, He swore by Himself! Our faithful God has so sworn for all who will be heirs of the promise.\r\n<p>Are we going to trust God?

God never has to excuse Himself with a \"Well, my intentions were good, but I failed.\" His ability to deliver on His promises is tied directly to His omnipotence. If God was not omnipotent, He would be unable to keep His promises. He could not give any of us assurance of salvation.\r\n<p>This attribute of God we call omnipotence does not really mean that God can do anything. It means that He is the only Being who can do anything He wills to do. We understand up to a point that God is perfect in love and wisdom, in holiness and strength. Still, it is impossible for us to comprehend what the Lord God means when He says, \"I am the holy God.\" We may, however, come to the understanding that \"holy\" is the way God is, and that He has made holiness the moral condition necessary to the health of His entire universe.','Psalm 99:9','Exalt the LORD our God and worship at his holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy.','<i>Holy is what God is.<i/> He is not only holy but He is holy.

Our sacrifice is not an animal offered by a priest as imperfect as we are. Our sacrifice is the very Lamb of God, who was able and willing to offer Himself to take away the sins of the world. Our altar is not the altar in old Jerusalem. Our altar is Calvary, where Jesus offered Himself without spot to God through the eternal Spirit. Our Holy of Holies is not that section of a temple made with hands, secluded behind a protective veil. Our Holy of Holies is in heaven, where the exalted Jesus sits at the right hand of the Majesty on high.\r\n<p>Note the comparison of the two priesthoods. In the Old Testament, every priest who ever served knew that he would ultimately be retired and die. Each priest was temporal. But in our Lord Jesus Christ we have an eternal High Priest.

It is for that very reason, the writer assures us, that Jesus is \"able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them\" (Hebrews 7:25).\r\n<p>Before we move on from the subject of the passing of the Old Testament priestly mediation, I want to mention the strange, anomalous event that took place within the Jerusalem Temple as Jesus gave up His life on the cross. As He \"gave up his spirit\" (John 19:30) outside Jerusalem, the very finger of God Almighty reached into the temple\'s most holy place, splitting, rending, tearing the heavy hanging veil.\r\n<p>That ancient veil was not just a curtain. It was a special drape — a veil so thick and heavy that it took several men to pull it aside. As Jesus died, the finger of God rent that veil which had housed the earthly presence of the invisible God. Thus, God was indicating the beginning of a new covenant and a new relationship between mankind and Himself. He was demonstrating the passing of the old order and the transfer of authority, efficacy and mediation to the new order.','Matthew 27:50-51','And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.

And remembered you in it? This will has been in effect ever since the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It promises an eternal inheritance through God\'s unbounded love and faithfulness.\r\n<p>Although it was a transaction that took place two millenniums ago, many people remain unaware that God has included them in His will. The letter to the Hebrews supplies us with the full details. Jesus Christ is Mediator of this new will. His death enabled sinful mankind to be pardoned and to receive an eternal inheritance. Here is what the writer to the Hebrew Christians has to say about it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrist is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance&#151;now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant. In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, . . . In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. . . . Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God\'s presence. Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him (Hebrews 9:15&#150;16, 22, 24&#150;28).\r\n<p>This Scripture encompasses so much instruction and so much meaning that we should stand back and view it from a better perspective. It is necessary sometimes to do that with great paintings. We can stand so close to the canvas that we note only the many little details, seeing them out of proportion and perhaps missing entirely the true beauty and meaning of the painting. I suggest we stand back from these verses and gaze in wondering faith as we contemplate God\'s grand design.','Hebrews 12:23b&#150;24','You\'ve come to Jesus, who presents us with a new covenant, a fresh charter from God. He is the Mediator of this covenant. The murder of Jesus, unlike Abel\'s&#151;a homicide that cried out for vengeance&#151;became a proclamation of grace <i>(The Message)<i/>','Out of His unfailing love and faithfulness, God has provided for us a radically new covenant of which Jesus is the mediator.

God had instructed Israel about this link. \"The life of a creature is in the blood,\" God said, \"and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one\'s life\" (Leviticus 17:11). This instruction concerning blood and the atonement was at the very heart of Israel\'s religion and her relationship with God. The blood was considered mysterious and sacred. Israelites were never to ingest blood.\r\n<p>The second thing I note is the relationship between sin and death. As human beings, we do not know all there is to know about death. There are religious groups who claim to believe in the annihilation of the human soul and the end of all existence. (Annihilation means to withdraw something from existence.)  In the scriptural account of creation God made something out of nothing. But there is no instance in Scripture where God reverses the process of creation and calls an existing thing back into nothingness. Nor is there the concept of annihilation in nature. It is hard, then, to understand why some people want to introduce annihilation into the kingdom of God.\r\n<p>Matter can be&#151;and regularly is&#151;changed. But matter cannot be annihilated. If I strike a wooden match and let it burn to ashes, I can pinch the remaining ash into a smudge on my fingers, but I have not annihilated the elements that were in that match. They merely changed form. Part of the match went up in smoke. Part of  it turned to ash. The part that became gaseous continues to possess invisible form in the atmosphere.','John 11:25&#150;26','Jesus said to her, \'I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\'','Death brings change, not annihilation.

There is only a change of residence at the time of death. The soul will change its location, but it will never cease to be. That is the crux of the Bible teaching on the worth and infinite nature of the God-breathed human soul.\r\n<p>Consider this human situation&#151;one many of us have witnessed at one time or another. A mother lovingly holds a tiny baby in her arms, a baby who is alive, cooing, alert, healthy. Then tragedy! Raging disease strikes down that same baby. The mother holds the infant form in her arms, but she is sobbing in grief. Death has robbed her of the object of her affection.\r\n<p>A brief service of loving memory will follow. In the tiny casket, the lifeless baby looks like a still, white angel.\r\n<p>What has happened?\r\n<p>Annihilation?\r\n<p>No! But there has been a change of form and existence&#151;for the parents, a shocking change. The soul within that baby, the active mind, the intelligence, the cooing and laughter&#151;all appear to have passed away. The lifeless body will be laid tenderly in the earth, where it finally will return to dust. But that living, individual soul will not be annihilated. Never! The soul has changed its place of existence, but it has not ceased to be.','John 14:3','And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.','Physical death brings a change of residence not an end to existence.

We believe the Bible when it says physical death is the reality facing every person born into the world. But there is also a very evident condition among us described as spiritual death. We trace it back to the Garden of Eden and the warning of God to our first parents: \"You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die\" (Genesis 2:16&#150;17). Adam and Eve did not heed the warning; they ate of the forbidden fruit. And on the day that they transgressed the law of God in disobedience and self-will, they died spiritually.\r\n<p>Death is not annihilation. Death is not cessation of existence. Death is a changed relationship in a different form of existence.\r\n<p>When Satan, a creation of God, rebelled in pride and disobedience, he was saying, \"I will arise and put my throne above the throne of God!\" And right there Satan died. But he did not cease to be. God expelled him from heaven and from fellowship with Himself. He cast him down to earth. And after all these centuries, Satan is still around. He was not annihilated, and his eternal judgment is still to come.','Galatians 6:8','The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit will reap eternal life.','Physical death graciously ushers the believer into the unveiled presence of God&#151;life to the maximum!

The Scriptures do not. Paul has a classic one-sentence commentary on the subject. He says the woman \"who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives\" (1 Timothy 5:6). She was not dead physically, but spiritually she was cut off from God. Her form of existence was such that she was not related to, but separated from, God.\r\n<p>The apostle also warns us that death is one of sin\'s fearful consequences. Sin came into the world and brought death with it. The soul that sins will die. So the Bible declares.\r\n<p>Another thing we see in the Hebrews Scripture earlier quoted is that God has a very simple way of dealing with sin. God terminates sin in death! I lived in Chicago when the notorious killer gangster, John Dillinger, was being hunted. The police printed pictures of Dillinger with warnings about his violence with guns. Always he was shown with a cynical, sarcastic smile on his face. But the final picture indicated that he had stopped sinning. He was lying on his back, toes up. He was covered with a sheet. Dillinger was dead.\r\n<p>Sin ends at death. When a person dies, he or she will sin no more. That is God\'s way of ending sin. He lets death terminate it.','First Tlimothy 5:6','But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.','Physical death terminates sin but the effects of unforgiven sin do not end.

Notice that there must be a blood atonement because blood and life have a vital, mysterious relationship.\r\n<p>The blood of Jesus Christ is of infinite value. The pouring out of blood indicates the termination of life. Because the blood of Jesus Christ, the eternal Son, the Lamb of God, was poured out, our acts of sin may be pardoned.\r\n<p>We need to give this spiritual truth all the reverence and contemplation it deserves. Do we talk too loosely about the price of our redemption? I confess that I cringe just a little when I hear someone speak about Christ paying our debt&#151;buying us back. Sometimes we make it sound like nothing more than a business deal. But I do not like to think of God redeeming us in the way we might redeem a cow or a horse at some livestock show.

When Jesus poured out His blood on Calvary,  He guaranteed eternal redemption to all who would put their trust in Him.\r\n<p>The blood and the life are one. When the blood was poured out, when Jesus Christ the eternal Son died, His death became vicarious. (<i>Vicarious<i/> is another word that needs a brief explanation. A vicarious act is one performed on behalf of someone else. When Jesus died at Calvary, it was a vicarious death. Jesus died on behalf of us all, the innocent One for the guilty many.)\r\n<p>The atoning, vicarious death of Jesus Christ for sinful humanity is at the very foundation of the Christian faith.

Such is the bountiful and enduring legacy that has come by faith to the believing children of God as a result of Jesus\' Calvary death.   \r\n<p>I want to conclude by pointing out something that will sound strange to any mortal human being.

We would have further reason to question the woman\'s sanity if at that point she called family and guests to the table, announcing cheerily, \"The shadow of the bread is ready. You may come!\"\r\n<p>Before I attempt a spiritual application of that unlikely scenario, consider how the writer to the Hebrews portrays the vast difference between the Old Testament \"shadow\" in the law and the reality of God\'s glory in the person of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord:\r\nThe law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming&#151;not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? . . . Then he said, \"Here I am, I have come to do your will.\" He sets aside the first to establish the second. And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. . . . But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God  (Hebrews 10:1&#150;2, 9&#150;10, 12).	\r\n<p>The inspired writer is plainly repetitious in his effort to fully contrast the Old Testament rituals, or shadows, with the perfections of grace, mercy and love found in the radiant, eternal person of Jesus, the Christ.

The writer is telling us that the true Light of God had fallen across the person of Jesus, the eternal Son. The shadow cast by that light and that Person was the temporary economy of the Old Testament.\r\n<p>We know very well the impossibility of trying to survive on a shadow. It cannot be done. The shadow has been cast by the light, but it has no being or substance of its own. If you are in need of nourishment, the shadow of a loaf of bread is of no avail. It will provide no food. You will continue to be hungry. You will say, \"I have had enough of shadow. Bring me the actual loaf of bread so I may eat and be satisfied!\"\r\n<p>So in those Old Testament times, the shadow of good things to come was not enough.

We must read or hear it more than once. God\'s method of instruction is \"Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule;  a little here, a little there\" (Isaiah 28:10)&#151;until we have received and learned and benefited.\r\n<p>In this process of learning, God has some problems with us.

We presume we are impressing high heaven by attending churches in large numbers. Surely God is still asking, \"Who told you to do this? When you come before Me, who has required this of you? Bring no more vain oblations!\"','John 14:26','But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.','Unless they express our whole heart, God is not impressed with our oblations&#151;our acts of worship, our good works, our giving.

What a church can or cannot do is decided by the state of the treasury. Its spiritual outgo is determined by its financial income, with no margin for miracle and no recognition of a spiritual ministry unrelated to money. Such evil practice results from an erroneous attitude toward the whole financial question as it relates to religion.','Nahum 1:7','The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble.

The moment he becomes important <i>because<i/> he is treasurer, the Spirit will be grieved and His manifestations will begin to diminish. Then will follow coldness and spiritual sterility which we will try desperately to cure by wild appeals to God for revival. That the revival never comes is due altogether to the fact that we are violating the laws of God and forcing the Spirit to withdraw His power from us.\r\n<p>Again, it is a sign and a portent when a member is cultivated for his generosity and given a place of eminence in the church out of proportion to his spiritual gifts and graces. To court a Christian for his financial contributions is as evil a thing as to marry a man for his money. To flatter a man for any reason whatever is to degrade ourselves and imperil his soul.

So entrenched is its authority and so stable are the religious habits of its members that God could withdraw Himself completely from it and it could run on for years on its own momentum. And the same is true of schools, Bible conferences and missionary societies.\r\n<p>It is particularly regrettable that the activities of churches and societies must be cut back to agree with actual or anticipated income. Think back to the roots of this practice and you will see that it makes the power of the Spirit of God depend upon the state of the national economy or the varying wage levels in different localities. Should the members of a local church withhold their tithes and offerings that church will accomplish less statistically, it is true, but always its accomplishments will depend upon its spiritual condition and not upon its treasury.

Paul sets this forth plainly enough in his First Corinthians epistle:\r\nFor the foolishness of God is wiser than man\'s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man\'s strength.\r\nBrothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things&#151;and the things that are not&#151;to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him (1 Corinthians 1:25&#150;29).\r\n<p>When God sent His Son to redeem mankind He sent Him to the home of a working man and He grew up to be what we now call a peasant. When He presented Himself to Israel and launched into His earthly ministry, He was rejected by the respectable religionists and had to look for followers almost exclusively from among the poor, plain people. When the Spirit came and the church was founded, its first members were the socially unacceptable. For generations the church drew her numbers from among the lower classes, individual exceptions occurring now and again, of which Saul of Tarsus was the most noteworthy.','First Corinthians 1:26','Take a good look, friends, at who you were when you got called into this life. I don\'t see many of \"the brightest and the best\" among you, not may influential, not many from high-society families <i>The Message.<i/>.','Of little importance is how others see us.

The institutionalized church has certainly not been poor, nor has she lacked for great and mighty men to swell her membership. But this great church has had no power. Almost always the approval of God has rested upon small and marginal groups whose members were scorned while they lived and managed to gain acceptance only after they had been safely dead several score years.\r\n<p>Today we evangelicals are showing signs that we are becoming too rich and too prominent for our own good. With a curious disregard for the lessons of history we are busy fighting for recognition by the world and acceptance by society. And we are winning both. The great and the mighty are now looking our way. The world seems about to come over and join us. Of course we must make some concessions, but these have almost all been made already except for a bit of compromising here and there on such matters as verbal inspiration, special creation, separation and religious tolerance.\r\n<p>Evangelical Christianity is fast becoming the religion of the bourgeoisie. The well-to-do, the upper middle classes, the politically prominent, the celebrities are accepting our religion by the thousands and parking their expensive cars outside our church doors, to the uncontrollable glee of our religious leaders who seem completely blind to the fact that the vast majority of these new patrons of the Lord of glory have not altered their moral habits in the slightest nor given any evidence of true conversion that would have been accepted by the saintly fathers who built the churches.\r\n<p>Yes, history is a great teacher, but she cannot teach those who do not want to learn.

He was loved for his ability to convulse a dignified assembly with his sidesplitting humor, sometimes aimed at one of the great men present or even at the king himself, though it was a bit risky to make the king the butt of a joke, for the jester never knew whether his majesty would accept it good-naturedly and laugh with the rest or have him whipped and thrown into prison for his impertinence. At best he was treated with the affection shown to a house pet; at worst he was kicked and cuffed about, either because his wit was too pointed or because he couldn’t think of anything funny when his royal boss called for it.\r\n<p>Seeing that we humans were once created in the image of God and that we have by our sin fallen into a state of spiritual blindness and mortality, I would rather be a serious-minded dolt concerned about eternal life than to be an overpaid jester with nothing better to do than to make men laugh and forget that they must die and come to judgment.','Psalm 95:6&#150;7','Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker; for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care.','Is it cultural pressure that has caused us to open our services of worship to \"court-jesters\"&#151;entertaining music, homilies and humor?

Happy is the newborn babe in Christ who can find a pure and holy soul whom he can take as a model and from whom he can learn the ways of the kingdom. Such a one can act as a mentor to save the young Christian from many mistakes and pitfalls into which he otherwise might fall.\r\n<p>Much is said about this in the Scriptures and many examples are found there. Joshua had his Moses, Elisha had his Elijah and Timothy his Paul. It speaks well of the humility of the younger men that they were willing to learn and of the patience of the older ones that they were willing to teach. Had Moses, for instance, withdrawn his company and refused to be bothered with the young Joshua the history of Israel would have been different, as it would have been also if Joshua had been too proud and self-assured to sit at the feet of Moses.\r\n<p>The master-disciple relationship is normal and wholesome up to a given point; after that it becomes harmful both to the master and to the disciple.

In addition to His healing ministry and His work of instructing in the truth, He engaged in another kind of activity which the Spirit calls simply \"doing good.\"\r\n<p>\"As he is, so are we in this world\" (1 John 4:17b, KJV). We who call ourselves by His name are under obligation to imitate Him in His deeds of kindness. In current Christian teaching it is usually assumed that the works we are called to do are miracles. It is a lot easier to apply every passage that speaks of good works to something big and dramatic than to accept it as meaning some plain, humble task of mercy such as clothing the naked and feeding the hungry. We of the evangelical fold are much more easily persuaded to pray all night for God to do a miracle than to put on our work clothes and help a neighbor.\r\n<p>Without doubt there are activities that take precedence over works of charity. One is the work of witnessing to the grace and power of God as expressed through Jesus Christ. This is set forth in Acts 1:8, \"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you: and you will be my witnesses.\"','Acts 9:36','In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha ( which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor.','Dorcas was one of those disciples who followed the example of Christ: she \"was always doing good and helping the poor.\" For her it was a habit of life, not just an occasional gesture.','For a variety of reasons, Lord, I\'m hesitant to reach out to those in need.

Lemuel’s description of a virtuous woman in the thirty-first chapter of Proverbs shows us one who is not only morally pure, but hard working and industrious too, and along with her housewifely activities she manages also to do many good works for others: \"She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy\" (Proverbs 31:20). Paul required that the women believers in the early Church \"dress modestly\" with modest apparel and good deeds (1 Timothy 2:9&#150;10). Before an elderly woman could be \"put on the list of widows\" (obviously received into the first Christian home for the aged), it had to be shown not only that she had professed to be a Christian but that she was \"and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds\" (5:10).','Titus 2:7a','In everything set them an example by doing what is good.','Like it or not, we are all setting examples.

If we are to help only the worthy, who then can qualify? The Christian can hide his goods away with a pure conscience, safe in the knowledge that he would help the poor if he could find any worthy of it.

I do not see how we can escape the force of this double witness; and to tell the truth, I do not believe any honest person can.\r\n<p>That we should do good in Christ’s name no one can deny.

In Matthew 5:16 He says plainly, \"Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds, and praise your Father in heaven.\" The words \"that they may see\" can only mean that it is His purpose to exhibit the righteous lives of His people before the unrighteous world, and the words \"and praise your Father in heaven\" tell us why He wants thus to exhibit them. It is that He may provide an example of godliness which will exercise strong moral influence upon persons who would otherwise not be affected.\r\n<p>That much is easy. The apparent contradiction comes further on when He says, \"Be careful not to do your \'acts of righteousness\' before men, to be seen by them.

While still a young man, in the presence of the holy Ark he let himself go in an ecstatic dance that delighted God as much as it outraged the coldhearted Michal.\r\n<p>For many years I had loved the Psalms of David before I knew why. I had returned to them again and again, almost I might say more than to any other portion of Scripture, and I chided myself for this preference for after all I was a New Testament believer and the Psalms belonged to the Old. Then one day I read a sentence from a little book by Horatius Bonar. It said simply, \"The Spirit of Jesus dwells in the Psalms.\" Then I knew and was satisfied.\r\n<p>David in the Spirit knew and communed with the One who was to be his son according to the flesh, \"and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead\" (Romans 1:4). It was the love of Christ that made David run. \"O love of Jesus! Blessed love!\"','Psalm 37:7a','Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him.','David waited patiently for the LORD. He delighted in the LORD and committed his way to Him. This was David\'s power source. It can be ours as well!','Lord, I have a hard time being still and waiting for You.

That those who continue impenitent to the end of their earthly lives will be banished from the presence of God forever is a truth as clearly taught in the Scriptures as the fall of man or the resurrection of the dead.\r\n<p>The Bible is an organic unity, one with itself throughout, and must be received in toto or in toto rejected. I dare not select the parts I want to believe and exclude what disturbs or offends me. That would be to set up my fallible reason as a criterion against which to judge infallible revelation, obviously in itself an unreasonable thing to do.\r\n<p>While it is true that I stand before the Bible to be judged and not the Bible before me; while it is true that I am morally obliged to accept the Holy Scriptures and by the light they afford prepare myself so the Holy Scriptures may accept me, as a serious-minded and responsible thinker I must admit that it is sometimes difficult to know precisely what the Scriptures teach on a given subject. When once we know, we must accept and believe; until we know we can maintain our moral integrity only by admitting our ignorance; and that very ignorance itself obliges us to search the Word in prayerful reverence until the light breaks and our doubts are cleared away.','Acts 17:11','Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.','Prayerful examination of God\'s Word is our responsibility as believers because we are personally accountable to expose ourselves to the Spirit\'s illumination.

By Your Spirit give me understanding.'),(1191,'The Warfare of the Spirit','10','Eternal Retribution&#151;A Bible Doctrine',NULL,'Painful Truths','The doctrine of eternal retribution has been held and taught by an overwhelming majority of Christians since the days of the apostles. Almost all, if not quite all, of the church fathers and of the great doctors and saints down the centuries believed that the Bible teaches that the finally impenitent will be cast into a hell from which there is no escape and with no further opportunity to repent and avail themselves of the mercy of God and the benefits of Christ\'s atonement. They believed, as the vast majority of Bible-loving Christians today believe, that the personality of the impenitent man is perpetuated beyond the moment of physical death, and that the man must face a strict accounting of deeds done on earth and hear the sentence of doom pronounced against him.\r\n<p>I have read the arguments put forth against this belief and acknowledged the force of them, and though my human heart could welcome any gleam of hope, however faint, that might yet remain for the lost, the Scriptures are too plain to allow that hope to exist.\r\n<p>Frederic W. Farrar, the celebrated dean of Canterbury, pleaded with great moral earnestness and overpowering eloquence for what he called \"eternal hope\" for all men, and like a defense attorney managed to find among the works of the Latin fathers quotations to support that hope. But the weight of evidence on the side of the traditional belief is too great; there can be only one conclusion: the Bible teaches the doctrine of eternal retribution, and every calm, reasonable man will accept the doctrine; or if he rejects it he will reject the Bible along with it. The man who will not believe in hell must surrender his right to believe in heaven.','Revelation 20:14&#150;15','Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. If anyone\'s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.','There are great truths of God\'s Word that are joyfully received. They give peace, hope, encouragement and much more. There are also truths that are painful to us.

But we should watch over our own hearts lest, unbeknown to us, we unconsciously welcome the idea of hell as the revenge we take against those who do not believe as we do. Just as the fear of excommunication or purgatory serves to keep the faithful Romanist in line, so it is entirely possible to use the fear of hell to make people knuckle under to the dictatorial pastor or the evangelist trying to fill his quota of converts for the evening.\r\n<p>The idea of hell found in the Scriptures is so fearful that the first impulse of a loving heart is to wish it were not so. But human pity is both a beautiful and a dangerous emotion. Unless it is subjected to the sharp critique of moral judgment it may, and often does, put our sympathies on the side of the murderer instead of on the side of the dead man and the widow and children he has left behind him. Unholy sympathy moves starry-eyed women to send flowers to the criminal awaiting execution while the innocent child he may have raped and mutilated scarcely rates a fugitive impulse of pity.\r\n<p>In the same way uninformed and unreasoning sympathy tends to take sides with the fallen and rebellious race of men against the Most High God whose name is Holy. That He gave men life and intelligence, that He has been patient with them while they defied His laws, killed His only begotten Son and scorned His dying love, is overlooked completely. That men use their gift of free will to reject God, choose iniquity and with wide open eyes persistently work to prepare themselves for hell, seems not to matter to some people. In a welter of uncontrollable emotion they throw themselves on the side of God\'s enemies. This is unbelief masquerading as compassion.','Second Peter 3:9','The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness.

Christ was dead, but His death was not an accident; neither was it the result of sickness or age. He died to vanquish hell and win heaven for men. Christ was dead, but He is not dead now. Lo! the Dead is living! And how can believing men keep silent?\r\n<p>No Bible-taught Christian can allow himself to live in bondage to days and times and seasons (Colossians 2:16&#150;17; Romans 14:4&#150;10; 2 Corinthians 3:5&#150;18). He knows he is free from the Law, and the Judaizing brethren who seek to rivet a yoke on his neck will not have much success. But he nevertheless appreciates the value of one day in seven to devote to prayer and praise.

The story of salvation should put a radiancy in the face and a vibrancy in the voice of him that tells it. Yet it is not uncommon to hear the wondrous message given in a manner that makes it difficult for the hearer to concentrate on what is being said. What is wrong?\r\n<p>The conventional answer, \"The speaker is not full of the Holy Spirit,\" does not tell us enough. Many who by every test of life and love are temples of the Spirit manage to sound like a worn-out phonograph record that was not very good in the first place.\r\n<p>It is true that only the Spirit-filled preacher can be morally effective at last; but for the moment we are thinking only of the ability of a speaker to command the attention of his hearers.

Why?\r\n<p>It would probably be an oversimplification to name any single cause as being alone responsible for the dullness of our preaching, but I nevertheless venture to suggest that one very important factor is our habit of laboring the obvious. (If any reader should smile and say, \"That is what this editorial is doing,\" I have no defense to offer. At least I see my fault and shall try to remedy it.)\r\n<p>In trying to discover the cause of my aversion to the ministry of certain evangelical Bible teachers I have concluded that it is their incurable habit of laboring the obvious. They seem not to know that elementary truths often repeated dull the spiritual faculties of the saints. Especially is this true when the teacher insists upon playing with theological blocks, spelling out the first principles of the doctrine of Christ apparently with no intention of going on.','Hebrews 5:13&#150;14','Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.

If the speaker can show that some elementary truth had been hidden in an Old Testament \"type\" and not before noticed, he is hailed as a profound Bible scholar and eagerly invited back next year.\r\n<p>This engrossment in first principles has an adverse effect upon the evangelical church. It is as if an intelligent child should be forced to stay in the third grade five or six years. The monotony is just too great. The mind cannot remain alert when the elements of surprise and disclosure are missing. Personally I sit through the average orthodox sermon with the same sense of bored frustration one might feel who was reading a mystery story through for the 12th time.\r\n<p>Our tendency to repeat endlessly a half dozen basic doctrines is the result of our lack of prophetic insight and our failure to meet God in living encounter. The knowledge of God presents a million facets, each one shining with a new ravishing light. The teacher who lives in the heart of God, reads Scriptures with warm devotion, undergoes the discipline and chastisement of the Holy Spirit and presses on toward perfection is sure every now and again to come upon fresh and blessed vistas of truth, old indeed as the Word itself, but bright as the dew on the grass in the morning. The heart that has seen the far glimpses of advanced truth will never be able to keep quiet about them. His experiences will get into his sermons one way or another, and his messages will carry an element of surprise and delight altogether absent from the ordinary Bible talks heard everywhere these days.','Hebrews 6:1&#150;2','Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God, instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.','Featuring repetition of elementary teachings with generous resort to stories, humor and entertainment caters to the flesh but it doesn\'t provide the solid food required for spiritual maturity.','Spirit of God, teach me and through me teach others, that we Your people may may move on from elementary teachings and awesomely grow in You.'),(1212,'The Warfare of the Spirit','16','Laboring the Obvious',NULL,'Toddler Playpens','Something within the heart of the normal man revolts against motion without progress.

It never seems to occur to anyone that there is true joy farther on if they would only escape from the circle and strike out for the hills of God.\r\n<p>To bring news already known; to marshal texts to prove truth everyone believes and no one disputes; to illustrate by endless stories doctrines long familiar; to lay again and again the foundations of repentance from dead works and faith toward God&#151;this is to labor the obvious.\r\n<p>\"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection.\"','Hebrews 6:1&#150;3','So come on, let\'s leave the preschool fingerpainting exercises on Christ and get on with the grand work of art.

The blind man is not held responsible to see nor the deaf man to hear. Even the most oppressive government imposes upon its citizens only such taxes, as it judges him able to pay. To demand more of any man is finally to destroy such ability as he may possess. Any government that would demand more of its citizens than they were able to pay would soon dry up all tribute at its roots and bring upon itself sure destruction.\r\n<p>In an odd but highly significant passage in the Holy Scriptures, we are told that God judges men according to their light.\r\nIn the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.

This is not to imply that God’s overlooking men in ancient times absolved them of all responsibility. No, for always there is the light of nature as well as the light of conscience, and these are made effective by \"The true light that gives light to every man . . . Coming into the world\" (John 1:9).\r\n<p>Paul cleared this up for us when he wrote, \"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law\" (Romans 2:12, KJV). Idolatry is a grave and destructive sin no matter where it is found; but the appearance of Jesus Christ as the Light of the world took away any flimsy excuses men might have had and made them instantly responsible to turn to God from idols. The same holds true wherever the gospel is preached. The heathen are not innocent before they have heard the gospel, but their responsibility is vastly increased after they have heard it.','Romans 1:20','For since the creation of the world God\'s invisible qualities&#151;his eternal power and divine nature&#151;have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.','The heavens declare the glory of God (Psalm 19:1) and there is light that gives light to every human (John 1:9).

In spite of the temporary lag in employment this is all true, and to a degree known nowhere else on earth (unless it is in our friendly sister country to the north, which I understand enjoys a prosperity equal to our own).\r\n<p>As sharers in a prosperous economy we Christians must not forget that ability involves responsibility. We have more than our fathers had, and are therefore able to do more for our fellow men than they could do. We are in danger of overlooking this. A larger income may be considered in either of two ways: (1) I earn more; therefore I can spend more and enjoy myself better. (2) I earn more; therefore I am able to do more good for more people and aid in the evangelization of more tribes and nations.\r\n<p>To use increased income to feed the flesh and enjoy greater luxuries is perfectly natural&#151;and that is precisely why it is wrong; it accords with fallen human nature and is of the essence of selfishness and sin. To accept a larger income as a means whereby we may lay up treasures in heaven accords with the teachings of Christ. Every Christian who has this problem to face should prayerfully consider his larger responsibility in the light of his increased ability.','Second Corinthians 9:6','Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.','Resources God has entrusted to us include our finances, time, opportunities, natural and spiritual gifts.

From the largest sheep the shepherd expects the most wool, and from the largest tree we expect the most fruit.\r\n<p>The rule for individual responsibility was laid down by Peter. \"If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides\" (1 Peter 4:11). With this agree the words of Paul:\r\nFor by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you (Romans 12:3).\r\n<p>Some Christians die young; others linger on and, like tall candles, burn down to the socket.

He may sleep through the sermon, or if he remains alert enough to hear it he will never apply it to his own life in a practical way; yet the sonorous sound of the benediction followed by the sweet choral response gives him the feeling that he has profited immeasurably by his attendance at church. On the way out he will smile, shake hands, congratulate the preacher and go his way completely unchanged. Tomorrow he will drive just as hard a bargain in his business, tell the same shady stories, cheat on his income tax, shout at the driver ahead of him, bark at his wife, overeat and otherwise live like the son of this world that he in fact is.\r\n<p>The next Sunday he will go to church again and for a few moments experience the same radiant feeling of well-being and good will toward men that he has enjoyed once a week for years.

The apostle John warned against one of its manifestations when he wrote, \"Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth. This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence\" (1 John 3:18&#150;19). Kierkegaard wisely said that there is nothing in the Holy Scriptures about loving man in the mass, only about loving our neighbor as yourself.

It was so also in the time of Christ\'s earthly ministry. Israel wallowed in unreality. The lives of the priests and people did not support their words. They talked a good life and lived a bad one.

We are all alike after all.\r\n<p>Well, all that I have said so far is but a circumlocutory way of getting at a well-known truth: that when mankind fell one effect of the fall was the loss of control. Those divinely implanted powers within him got out of hand and turned from their normal uses to become servants of the flesh and the devil.\r\n<p>It has been obvious to me that almost every sin is but a natural good perverted or carried to excess. Self-respect is turned into pride; natural appetite becomes gluttony; sleep goes on to become sloth; sex goes awry and turns to sodomy; love degenerates into lechery; praise sinks to flattery; determination hardens into obstinacy; a natural childish love of play grows up with the man and becomes a multi-billion dollar business wherein tens of thousands of able-bodied persons waste their lives playing for the amusement of the millions of bored adults who are more than willing to work hard to obtain money to watch them play.','Galatians 5:22&#150;23','But the fruit of the Spirit is . . . self-control.','Self-control delivers from excess. But control in certain areas of life often encourages excess in others. We ourselves are unable to master all of our tendencies and desires.

From our low viewpoint it would appear much easier to create the human race than to recreate it; it would seem far less difficult to make a man in the divine image than to remake him in that image after he had been stamped with the likeness of sin. But since God has all the power there is to achieve the purposes conceived by all the wisdom there is, we may relieve ourselves of any anxiety. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.\r\n<p>The problem God faced in redemption is manyfold. How to square the moral account so that God might be just and the Justifier of them that believe; how to reconcile man to Himself; how to recreate a human spirit while allowing all the essential qualities to remain; how to indwell a personality without displacing it; how to work in the believing man\'s heart, turn it toward righteousness and still leave free the human will&#151;these are some of the problems, to us impossible but to God not only possible but effortlessly easy.\r\n<p>The question of control enters here, for if the work of redemption is to be complete our basic propensity toward perversion and excess must be reversed. All our powers must be sanctified and brought under the direction of the Spirit. From His throne in the believer\'s heart Christ must reign over the entire kingdom of Mansoul with all its precincts and provinces. The age-old curse of inordinateness and excess must be destroyed.\r\n<p>For this reason the beautiful word temperance occurs strategically in the theology of the New Testament.

This the Bible teaches with great plainness and candor as in such passages as these: \"For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands\" (2 Timothy 1:6). \"Encourage one another daily\" (Hebrews 3:13). Every call to repentance, every exhortation to advance in the spiritual life, is meant to arouse the sluggish heart to seek God and His righteousness. Christ Himself was \"moved with compassion\" when He saw the hungry multitudes. Paul\'s Macedonian vision was given to stimulate missionary action.

The theology of Christmas too easily gets lost under the gay wrappings, yet apart from its theological meaning it really has none at all.

Around this one dogma the whole question of meaning revolves. God did come or He did not; He is come or He is not, and the vast accumulation of sentimental notions and romantic practices that go to make up our modern Christmas cannot give evidence on one side or the other.\r\n<p>Certain religious teachers in apostolic times refused to believe that Jesus was actually God come in the flesh. They were willing to exhaust the language of unctuous flattery to describe His glorious manhood, but they would have none of His deity. Their basic philosophy forbade them to believe that there could ever be a union of God and human flesh. Matter, they said, is essentially evil. God who is impeccably holy could never allow Himself contact with evil. Human flesh is matter, therefore God is not come in the flesh.\r\n<p>Certainly it would not be difficult to refute this negative teaching. One would only need to demonstrate the error of the major premise, the essential sinfulness of matter, and the whole thing would collapse.

In the New Testament unbelief is a sin, and this could not be so if belief were no more than a verdict based upon evidence. There is nothing unreasonable about the Christian message, but its appeal is not primarily to reason. At a specific time in a certain place God became flesh, but the transcendence of Christ over the human conscience is not historic; it is intimate, direct and personal.\r\n<p>Christ\'s coming to Bethlehem\'s manger was in harmony with the primary fact of His secret presence in the world in preincarnate times as the Light that lighteth every man. The sum of the New Testament teaching about this is that Christ\'s claims are self-validating and will be rejected only by those who love evil. Whenever Christ is preached in the power of the Spirit, a judgment seat is erected and each hearer stands to be judged by his response to the message. His moral responsibility is not to a lesson in religious history but to the divine Person who now confronts him.\r\n<p>\"Everywhere, everywhere, Christmas tonight.\" But Christmas either means more than is popularly supposed or it means nothing.

Meister Eckhart said that when we rise above sin and turn away from it, God will act as if we had never sinned at all and will never let our past sins count against us, for He is a God of the present and takes a man as He finds him without regard to his past. Of course this all presupposes true repentance and faith and is written not to minimize sin but to magnify grace.\r\n<p>So much for last year; but what about the year ahead?

Its usefulness lies in this, that it provides background material which the average Christian is not able to gather for himself and thus often proves a real aid in the study of the Bible.\r\n<p>But it is not an unmixed blessing. It has at least three serious weaknesses. One is that it soon becomes known as an \"authority.\" Let a man be quoted often enough and be dead long enough and he is likely to be canonized by his grateful readers and his writings given oracular standing before the Christian public. The pronouncement of a revered commentator often exercises over the mind of a Protestant a sway as tyrannical as that of a papal bull over the conscience of a Catholic.\r\n<p>Another disadvantage of a commentary is that it tends to destroy the art of meditation. We find it easier to turn to the commentary than to brood long and lovingly over a difficult passage, waiting for the light to break. This habit of taking the quick and painless way to knowledge is particularly bad for the minister, for it often sends him into the pulpit with borrowed armor. Even if what he learned is true, he got it by consultation instead of by meditation and the quality is sure to be impaired.\r\n<p>A third weakness of the commentary, or at least of the commentary habit, is that it makes for a uniformity of belief not only on major theological tenets, which is desirable, but on minor ones, which is not. Let a hundred preachers lean on Matthew Henry or Adam Clarke. Then let each preacher be heard by 500 parishioners each Sunday for a year. Result: you have thousands of Christians accepting as divine truth the religious opinions of two good and wise men, opinions which may in the first place have been nothing more than educated guesses. And yet, in spite of these drawbacks, a commentary is a good and useful tool for any Christian to own','Psalm 1:2','Instead you thrill to God\'s Word, you chew on Scripture day and night.

They almost always walk and if occasionally they run, they never run fast or far, and they rarely mount up with wings as eagles. For this reason I turn frequently with considerable pleasure to Charles Wesley\'s poetic commentary, a modest work of only 1,100 pages, printed in London in the last decade of the 18th century.\r\n<p>Wesley admits that many of his thoughts are gleaned from others, but a deep reverence permeates the whole, and a glowing love for God and the inspired Word breathes on every page. It is possible in such a small work to touch only the shining peaks of truth, so the commentary is far from complete; but often the hymnist puts into a single stanza a happy comment which, if not so informative, is highly stimulating to the religious imagination. I offer here a few examples taken from the section on the Book of Exodus.\r\n<p>When God told Moses to go unto Pharaoh and demand the release of Israel, Moses pleaded, \"O Lord, I have never been eloquent\" (Exodus 4:10).

So deep in me the evil lies!<br>\r\nChastised a thousand times in vain, I still against Thy judgments rise;<br>\r\nNot all Thy judgments can convert This sinner, or this sin remove,<br>\r\nUnless Thou find it in Thy heart To soften mine by pardoning love.\r\n<p>How easy it is to read the dramatic story of the Exodus without profit; but in Wesley\'s musical commentary everything that happened there has a meaning for the Christian. For instance, the whole matter of God turning Egypt\'s water into blood ceases to be a problem to cloud the mind and becomes sunshine for the heart. The words \"The waters . . . Were turned to blood\" receive this happy comment,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned their water into blood, When vengeance was His dread design:<br>\r\nBut thanks to the incarnate God, He turned our water into wine!','Micah 7:18','Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?

A denomination is but \"the lengthened shadow of a man,\" and the man whose shadow it is must have had powerful convictions concerning certain particular truths or he would not have founded the denomination in the first place.

I am sure we do not mean to do this, but it is what too often happens nevertheless. Of course narrowness, intolerance and bigotry result from this as certainly as an oak from an acorn.\r\n<p>I have seen the motto, \"In essentials unity; in nonessentials charity,\" and I have looked for its incarnation in men and churches without finding it, one reason being that Christians cannot agree on what is and what is not essential. Each one believes that his fragment of truth is essential and his neighbor’s unessential, and that brings us right back where we started.\r\n<p>Unity among Christians will not, in my opinion, be achieved short of the Second Advent. There are too many factors working against it. But a greater degree of unity might be realized if we all approached the truth with deeper humility.

Great and good men have differed about the meaning of certain texts, but all served their generation by the will of God and fell on sleep. Christ said not, \"I am the truths,\" but \"I am the Truth.\" He gathers up in Himself all truth and truths. To know Him is to know the Truth in living experience, but it is not to know all truths in intellectual apprehension. Let us be careful lest we see a truth in the Word and mistake it for the Truth. There is a mighty difference.\r\n<p>It has always been a source of great delight to me to discover the hymns of the Calvinists Watts, Newton and Cowper in the hymnbook edited by John Wesley, the Arminian. And not a few of the Wesleyan hymns are bound up with the hymns of Isaac Watts published as long ago as 1823.\r\n<p>When Wesley was dying, so we are told, he tried to sing, though his voice was all but gone from him.

The theory of coal never turned a wheel nor warmed a hearth. Power must be released to be made effective.\r\n<p>In the redemptive work of Christ three major epochs may be noted: His birth, His death and His subsequent elevation to the right hand of God. These are the three main pillars that uphold the temple of Christianity; upon them rest all the hopes of mankind, world without end. All else that He did takes its meaning from these three Godlike deeds.\r\n<p>It is imperative that we believe all these truths, but the big question is where to lay the emphasis. Which truth should, at a given time, receive the sharpest accent? We are exhorted to look unto Jesus, but where shall we look? Unto Jesus in the manger? on the cross? at the throne? These questions are far from academic. It is of great practical importance to us that we get the right answer.','Hebrews 2:9','But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.','Christ no longer lives in a manger as a new-born baby nor is He hanging on a cross, dying for our sin. He is risen from the dead! He is exalted at the Father\'s right hand! It is the <i>living, glorified Christ<i/> whom we worship.

All that is symbolized by these three objects must be present to the gaze of faith; all is necessary to a proper understanding of the Christian evangel. No single tenet of our creed must be abandoned or even relaxed, for each is joined to the other by a living bond. But while all truth is to be at all times held inviolate, not every truth is to be at all times emphasized equally with every other. Our Lord indicated as much when He spoke of the faithful and wise steward who gave to his master\'s household \"their food allowance at the proper time\" (Luke 12:42b).\r\n<p>Mary brought forth her firstborn Son and wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger. Wise men came to worship, shepherds wondered and angels chanted of peace and good will towards men. All taken together this scene is so chastely beautiful, so winsome, so tender, that the like of it is not found anywhere in the literature of the world. It is not hard to see why Christians have tended to place such emphasis upon the manger, the meek-eyed virgin and the Christ child. In certain Christian circles the major emphasis is made to fall upon the child in the manger. Why this is so is understandable, but the emphasis is nevertheless misplaced.\r\n<p>Christ was born that He might become a man and became a man that He might give His life a ransom for many. Neither the birth nor the dying were ends in themselves. As He was born to die, so did He die that He might atone, and rise that He might justify freely all who take refuge in Him. His birth and His death are history. His appearance at the mercy seat is not history past, but a present, continuing fact, to the instructed Christian the most glorious fact his trusting heart can entertain.','Hebrews 7:24&#150;25','Because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.

Indeed, New Testament theology nowhere presents the Christ child as an object of saving faith. The gospel that stops at the manger is another gospel and no good news at all. The church that still gathers around the manger can only be weak and misty-eyed, mistaking sentimentality for the power of the Holy Spirit.\r\n<p>As there is now no babe in the manger at Bethlehem so there is no man on the cross at Jerusalem. To worship the babe in the manger or the man on the cross is to reverse the redemptive processes of God and turn the clock back on His eternal purposes. Let the church place its major emphasis upon the cross and there can be only pessimism, gloom and fruitless remorse. Let a sick man die hugging a crucifix and what have we there? Two dead men in a bed, neither of which can help the other.\r\n<p>The glory of the Christian faith is that the Christ who died for our sins rose again for our justification. We should joyfully remember His birth and gratefully muse on His dying, but the crown of all our hopes is with Him at the Father’s right hand.','Romans 4:25','He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.','Without the resurrection the manger is a sentimental pause and the cross a human tragedy.

They track us into the atomic age, through the space age and on into the golden age. They reveal that at an appropriate time the direction of the world will be taken away from men and placed in the hands of the Man who alone has the wisdom and power to rule it.\r\n<p>I omit here purposely the details. These are given in satisfying fullness in the writings of the holy prophets and apostles and in the words of Christ spoken while He was yet among us.

These disciples were to be taught to observe the commandments of Christ. They would thus become a minority group, a peculiar people, in the world but not of it, sometimes tolerated but more often despised and persecuted. And history demonstrates that this is exactly what happened wherever groups of people took the gospel seriously.\r\n<p>To expect of once-born nations conduct possible only to the regenerated, purified, Spirit-led followers of Christ is to confuse the truth of Christianity and hope for the impossible.

That weakness is the naive assumption that we have only to reach the last tribe with our brand of Christianity and the world has been evangelized. This is an assumption that we dare not make.\r\n<p>Evangelical Christianity, at least in the United States, is now tragically below the New Testament standard. Worldliness is an accepted part of our way of life. Our religious mood is social instead of spiritual. We have lost the art of worship. We are not producing saints.

I think the difficulty lies with our failure to distinguish freedom from liberty, which are indeed sisters but not identical twins.\r\n<p>Freedom is liberty within bounds: liberty to obey holy laws, liberty to keep the commandments of Christ, to serve mankind, to develop to the full all the latent possibilities within our redeemed natures. True Christian liberty never sets us free to indulge our lusts or to follow our fallen impulses.\r\n<p>The desire for unqualified freedom caused the fall of Lucifer and wrought the destruction of the angels that sinned. These sought freedom to do as they willed, and to get it they threw away the beautiful liberty that meant freedom to do the will of God.

The glory of heaven lies in the character of the freedom enjoyed by those who dwell therein. That innumerable company of angels, the general assembly and church of the Firstborn and the spirits of just men made perfect are at liberty to fulfill all the broad purposes of God, and this liberty secures for them an infinitely greater degree of happiness than unqualified freedom could do.\r\n<p>Unqualified freedom in any area of human life is deadly. In government it is anarchy, in domestic life free love, and in religion antinomianism. The freest cells in the body are cancer cells, but they kill the organism where they grow. A healthy society requires that its members accept a limited freedom. Each must curtail his own liberty that all may be free, and this law runs throughout all the created universe, including the kingdom of God.\r\n<p>Too much liberty weakens whatever it touches. The corn of wheat can bring forth fruit only as it waives its freedom and surrenders itself to the laws of nature. The robin may fly about all summer enjoying her freedom, but if she wants a nest full of fledglings she must sit for weeks a voluntary captive while the mystery of life gestates beneath her soft feathers.

While he lives he remains socially sterile and when he dies he leaves behind him nothing to make the world glad he lived.\r\n<p>The Christian cannot escape the peril of too much liberty. He is indeed free, but his very freedom may prove a source of real temptation to him. He is free from the chains of sin, free from the moral consequences of evil acts now forgiven, free from the curse of the law and the displeasure of God. Grace has opened the prison door for him, and like Barabbas of old he walks at liberty because Another died in his stead.\r\n<p>All this the instructed Christian knows and he refuses to let false teachers and misguided religionists rivet a yoke of bondage upon his neck. But now what shall he do with his freedom? Two possibilities offer themselves. He may accept his blood-won freedom as a cloak for the flesh, as the New Testament declares that some have done, or he may kneel like the camel to receive his voluntary burden. And what is this burden? The woes of his fellowmen which he must do what he can to assuage; the debt which he along with Paul owes to the lost world; the sound of hungry children crying in the night; the church in Babylonian captivity; the swift onrush of evil doctrines and the success of false prophets; the slow decay of the moral foundations of the so-called Christian nations and whatever else demands self-sacrifice, cross-carrying, long prayer vigils and courageous witness to alleviate and correct.','First Peter 2:16','Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.','The limited freedom that is ours we may exercise as a cloak for evil or to serve God.

That the church has made history is not so significant as that you have and I have. What is done by a group is possible only because individuals have been at work.

Paul by inspiration singled out the individual and stood him up alone to receive judgment:\r\nHis work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light.

It is well that we learn to do the same.\r\n<p>Yet I do not advise that we end the year on a somber note. The march, not the dirge, has ever been the music of Christianity. If we are good students in the school of life, there is much that the years have to teach us. But the Christian is more than a student, more than a philosopher. He is a believer, and the object of his faith makes the difference, the mighty difference.\r\n<p>Of all persons the Christian should be best prepared for whatever the New Year brings.

The Old Testament is helpful reading, not because of any worthy qualities it reveals about Israel but because in it we see the great kindness and long-suffering of God toward a dull and wrongheaded people who managed to go through school without learning anything.\r\n<p>Because Israel could not or would not learn from experience they were at various times defeated, oppressed, dispossessed, and at last they were rejected outright and dispersed throughout the world. The presence of Jews in every corner of the world is a witness to this.\r\n<p>That Israel should have learned and did not is no proof that they were more obtuse than the rest of us; it proves rather that they were very much like us.

A discontented man of great spiritual desire was joined by a few others of like mind. These had or soon received clear religious experience that gave urgency to their witness and zeal to their efforts. Usually they threw off the burden of religious complexities and turned to simplicity and inwardness. So great was the relief that those who rushed to join them felt that they had indeed recaptured the glory of the Early Church, and not one of them would have believed that their precious God-enamored band of Christians could ever forget.\r\n<p>But they did. Or if they did not, the next generation did. It is one of the anomalies of religion that the second generation members of a spiritual movement usually go back to the bondage from which their fathers escaped such a short while before. With many sad examples to warn them they yet move as if hypnotized or sleepwalking straight back into captivity. They will not learn from others\' experience.\r\n<p>The same is true of local churches.

The measure of freedom we of the Western world enjoy today is a gift to us from God&#151;and from our nonconforming forebears.\r\n<p>We Protestants owe our religious freedom and the blessing of an open Bible to men whose sepulchers we now delight to build, but whom we might not so willingly have aided if we had lived at the time when the outcome of their struggles was in doubt.\r\n<p>Conformity to the Word of God is always right, but obedience to religious leaders is good only if those leaders prove themselves worthy to lead. Leadership in the church of Christ is a spiritual thing and should be so understood by everyone. It takes more than a ballot to make a leader.','First John 3:7a','Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray.','We are no longer to be conformed to the pattern of this world but to be transformed by mind renewal. That nonconformity extends to refusing to follow leaders who would wrongly lead us, rather submitting to those whom God has raised up for such an hour as this.','O Lord, give us leaders who clearly discern Your leading and provide us the wisdom to follow them as they follow You.'),(1274,'The Warfare of the Spirit','35','Conformity, a Snare in Religion',NULL,'Leaders:  God-Chosen or Man-Chosen','There is great danger in our present-day evangelical circles that we place too great importance on conformity to authorities within the churches and so stifle whatever originality and daring there may be among us. That denomination is in grave peril when the only virtue required of its ministers is conformity and the only unforgivable ecclesiastical sin is insubordination.\r\n<p>This situation develops when church authorities are placed in office by machinery instead of being commissioned by the Holy Spirit. To stay in the ascendancy these leaders must demand and get conformity to protect rules on the part of those under them. Such as these would far rather preside over a denomination of mediocre conformists than to be embarrassed by the presence of anointed men of vision who might unwittingly steal the hearts of the people from them. Thus when a head appears slightly above the dead level of flat conformity it is gently lopped off, ostensibly to protect the work of the Lord, but actually to retain control of the ecclesiastical machine.\r\n<p>No Spirit-led man is afraid of losing his position in a Spirit-filled church. Where the church is conceived to be no more than an institution, then every man honored by a place on the hierarchical totem pole will seek to preserve his treasured niche, or to secure a higher one. Then he will look for a technique for survival, and over the years imposed conformity has been the one most frequently employed by the largest number.','Ezekiel 1:3','There the hand of the LORD was upon him.','Blessed is the church that recognizes the hand of the Lord upon those whom <i>He<i/> has prepared to lead.

It is highly significant that when the apostle Paul found it necessary to ask for obedience among the young churches he never appealed to them on the grounds that he had been duly elected to office. He asserted his authority as an apostle appointed by the Head of the church. He held his position by right of sheer spiritual ascendancy, the only earthly right that should be honored among the children of the new creation.\r\n<p>In the church or denomination where the Holy Spirit is in control there will be no imposed conformity, but there will be happy cooperation with the anointed leaders on the part of all. The rank-and-file soldiers of the King will recognize their true leaders; they will be the ones not with the epaulets on their shoulders but with the oil on their foreheads.','Romans 12: 6, 8','We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. . . .

In short, the Christ of the New Testament and the world of mankind are so sharply opposed to each other as to amount to downright hostility. To achieve a compromise is impossible.\r\n<p>We can only conclude that Jesus is universally popular today because He is universally misunderstood.\r\n<p>Everyone admires Jesus, but almost no one takes Him seriously. He is considered a kindly idealist who loved babies and underprivileged persons. He is pictured as a gentle dreamer who was naïve enough to believe in human goodness and brave enough to die for His belief. The world thinks of Him as meek, selfless and loving, and values Him because He was what we all are at heart, or would be if things were not so tough and we had more time to cultivate our virtues. Or He is a sweet, holy symbol of something too fine, too beautiful, to be real, but something which we would not lose nevertheless from our treasure house of precious things.\r\n<p>Because the human mind has two compartments, the practical and the ideal, people are able to live comfortably with their dreamy, romantic conception of Jesus while paying no attention whatsoever to His words. It is this neat division between the fanciful and the real that enables countless thousands of persons to say \"Lord, Lord\" in all sincerity while living every moment in flat defiance of His authority.','Luke 6:46','Why do you call me \'Lord, Lord,\' and do not what I say?','Christ is only our Lord as we submit to His lordship.

The contradiction between Christ and unregenerate society is sharp and irreconcilable, but the contrast between society and its own mistaken conception of Him is scarcely noticeable. So the world can cherish its image of Christ and ignore His commandments without a qualm of conscience.\r\n<p>What should seriously concern us, however, is not that the world praises Christ without obeying Him, but that the church does. The men of this world go their way careless of the teachings of Christ, but in doing so they are consistent with their position. They have made no vows to the Lord nor taken His name upon them. But when a Christian ignores the commandment of Christ, he is guilty of sin doubly compounded. He violates holy vows, is guilty of rebellion against God and commits the grotesque sin of calling Jesus Lord with his words and denying His Lordship with his deeds.','John 15:18&#150;19','If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.

And so with too many churches also Jesus is popular but impotent. Surely another reformation is indicated.','Second Timothy 2:15','Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.','There is the dangerous tendency among us to treat Scripture passages that condemn our practice as non-universal, restricted in application to the historical and cultural context in which they occur.

This manifesto declares that Christ is God of the substance of His Father, begotten before all ages: Man of the substance of His mother, born in the world: perfect God and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting: Equal to His Father, as touching His Godhead: less than the Father, as touching His manhood. Who, although He be God and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ. One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by the taking of the manhood into God. One altogether, not by the confusion of substance, but by the unity of Person.

Today He is a real man, of the race of mankind, bearing our lineaments and dimensions, a visible and audible man whom any other man would recognize instantly as one of us.\r\n<p>But more than this, He is heir of all things, Lord of all worlds, Head of the church and the Firstborn of the new creation. He is the way to God, the life of the believer, the hope of Israel and the high priest of every true worshiper. He holds the keys of death and hell and stands as advocate and surety for everyone who believes on Him in truth.\r\n<p>This is not all that can be said about Him, for were all said that might be said I suppose the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.

He is cooed over by women disappointed in love, patronized by pro tem celebrities and recommended by psychiatrists as a model of a well-integrated personality.

The vulgar person is one of low tastes who is not only coarse and boorish but enjoys being so, and because his kind is often in the majority he is also said to be common. And it is this common fellow who has, unfortunately, become the model for the masses in human society.\r\n<p>The present clamor after a college education by such large numbers of our young people suggests that perhaps people are getting tired of being common and aspire to loftier and nobler lives. But this is an illusion. Whatever advanced education may do for us theoretically, it is a fact that the stream of college graduates being poured each year into the social current is not having the slightest ennobling effect upon society. It is rather the other way around; society quickly brings the graduate around to its way of thinking and living.\r\n<p>Vulgarity is a disease of the human spirit and is not cured by education, or travel, or familiarity with grand opera or works of art.

Had Pharaoh been wise, or even shrewd, he would have eased the pressure on the Hebrews a little and so continued to enjoy the benefits of their free labor for years to come.

When the body of Haman swung back and forth on the gallows he had built for another, the folly of unrighteousness was exposed in a way and to a degree that must have surprised Satan. The world now knows, or can know if it will, that every gallows built to destroy good men will hang the builder at last. Justice may be a long time getting around to it, but evil will hang finally. Satan did not know this, or if he did he never intended that the secret should get out; either way his supposed shrewdness failed him.\r\n<p>Then, Satan\'s long, unrelenting warfare against the church has never been successful, and this has been at least partly due to his own unwisdom.

The excellence of a horse (as Plato said somewhere) lies in the perfection of the qualities that make it a horse&#151;strength, speed, intelligence, et cetera&#151;and these cannot be transferred to something else. Give to a wren, for instance, the qualities that constitute a good horse and you have a grotesque monster that is neither wren nor horse. How unthinkable for a wren to perch on the back of the horse and ride proudly by under the mistaken impression that it has now reached his complete fulfillment. No. The horse cannot impart anything to the nature of the wren that will add to its excellence as a wren. Let the wren know itself and seek its fulfillment singing beside its nest and gathering food for its young, not in trying to borrow a glory that must be forever foreign to it.\r\n<p>And so with a man. . . .','Luke 12:15','Then he said to them, \'Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man\'s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\'','We are not defined by our abundance of possessions or lack of them. Unrestrained craving for things can become a cancer of the heart. And all the things must one day be left behind.

Help me to maintain proper perspective.'),(1292,'The Warfare of the Spirit','40','The Man and the Machine',NULL,'What <i>Really<i/> Counts','The excellence of a man lies in the perfection of his human nature. God made him with powers no other being possesses and gave him a physical body through which to express these powers fruitfully. An automobile has another and a different excellence; it can add nothing to the glory of the man.\r\n<p>Our Lord, riding into Jerusalem on the back of a humble beast, lost nothing of the majesty that was His as the world\'s most perfect man; conversely, a little, selfish, frightened man gains no dignity from the expensive and shiny steel monster in which he rides. That he feels greater only accents his feebleness; that he acts as if he were greater only reveals more clearly the basic error in his total life philosophy. He accepts as real the illusion that he is more powerful, when in fact the power lies outside of him. His imagined excellence is the excellence of a piece of machinery, something he must share with the little dog that sits beside him with his head out the window.\r\n<p>The whole point is that human excellence consists in the perfection of human nature.

Let five men be cast adrift in a lifeboat and immediately one of them assumes command. No plebiscite is necessary. Four of the men will know by a kind of intuition who the strong, wise man is, and without any formality he will take charge of things and become the leader.\r\n<p>Every disaster, every fire, every flood elects its own leaders. At such times the people listen without question to the man who has the presence of mind and the boldness to take command. In retrospect the weaker ones may find fault, but they were glad enough for the leadership when the crisis was on.\r\n<p>Among Christians too there are leaders and followers. The followers may resent the leader, but they need him nevertheless, and follow him too, even if a little sulkily sometimes.','First Peter 5:2-3',' Be shepherds of God\'s flock that is under your care, serving as overseers&#151;not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.','God calls some sheep to shepherd His flock under His shepherding. Primary in the shepherd\'s task is to be an example to the flock. That is difficult when some sheep resist shepherding. Vital to the shepherd is the assurance that the Great Shepherd has called him, otherwise disaster.','Thank You, Father, for shepherds under whose care You have placed me. May I be faithful in praying for them.'),(1295,'The Warfare of the Spirit','41','Leaders and Followers',NULL,'Shepherds Are Also Sheep','The ideal would be that the sheep follow none but the Chief Shepherd and ignore all other leaders; and occasionally indeed an individualist is found who insists that he follows only the Lord and stubbornly refuses to listen to human teachers or to take part in the activities of the Christian community. While we respect the right of such a man to his own convictions, it must be said nevertheless that he is bound to be and to remain weak and fruitless. By detaching himself from the flock of the Lord he misses the green pastures and the still waters.\r\n<p>In the church of God there must be leaders; but the leader must also be a follower. Paul gave us the pattern when he exhorted the Corinthians, \"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ\" (1 Corinthians 11:1). To follow a leader who is faithfully following the Lord is to follow the Lord; to follow one who is not a follower of Christ is to end in disaster.\r\n<p>But how can we be sure? How can we know whom to trust? To the law and to the testimony! If the teacher speaks not according to God’s Word there is no light in him. To follow a religious leader for his eloquence or his attractive personality is to travel on a very dangerous path. Many have done it to their everlasting sorrow and loss.','First Corinthians 11:1','Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.','Pastor-shepherds must frequently remind themselves that they are also sheep. It is imperative that they diligently follow the Great Shepherd in order to lead the sheep under their care. A straying pastor-shepherd can dangerously mislead sheep, and of that there are too many examples.','Great Shepherd, I sometimes forget that pastor-shepherds have sheep characteristics and weaknesses. For them may I be a pray-er not a complainer.'),(1296,'The Warfare of the Spirit','41','Leaders and Followers',NULL,'Reluctant Leaders','The true and safe leader is likely to be the one who has no desire to lead but is forced into a position of leadership by the inward pressure of the Spirit and the press of the external situation. Such were Moses, David and the Old Testament prophets; and I think there was hardly a great Christian leader from Paul to this present day but was drafted by the Holy Spirit for the task and commissioned by the Lord of the Church to fill a position he had little natural heart for.\r\n<p>I believe that it might be accepted as a fairly reliable rule of thumb that the man who is ambitious to lead is disqualified as a leader. The Church of the Firstborn is no place for the demagogue or the petty religious dictator. The true leader will have no wish to lord it over God’s heritage, but will be humble, gentle, self-sacrificing and altogether as ready to follow as to lead when the Spirit makes it plain to him that a wiser and more gifted man than himself has appeared.\r\n<p>It is undoubtedly true, as I have said so often, that the church is languishing not for leaders but for the right kind of leaders; for the wrong kind is worse than none at all. Better to stand still than to follow a blind man over a precipice. History will show that the church has prospered most when blessed with strong leaders and suffered the greatest decline when her leaders were weak and time serving. The sheep rarely go much farther than the Shepherd.\r\n<p>That is why unqualified democracy is not good for a church unless every voting member is full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom. To put the work of the church in the hands of the group is to exchange one leader for many; and if the group is composed of carnal professors it is to exchange one weak leader for a number of bad ones. One hundred blind men cannot see any better than one.','Matthew 15:14','Leave them; they are blind guides.  If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.','It is one thing to discern and obey God\'s will for yourself.  It is quite another to have the responsibility of leading large numbers of people.  Who would ever desire such a heavy load?  Sometimes it is those who are not gifted by the Spirit or closely following the Lord themselves.  God-gifted leaders are often reluctant to lead.','Father, give us leaders gifted by You and filled with Your Spirit.  Then give us the good sense to recognize and follow them as they follow You.'),(1297,'The Warfare of the Spirit','41','Leaders and Followers',NULL,'Gifted Leaders','The ideal leader is one who hears the voice of God and beckons the people on as the voice calls him and them. But unfortunately not all leaders are ideal ones. Too many lead by following. One of the most comical sights in the whole world of religious activities is to see an uncertain leader trying to discover the direction the people want him to lead them and then scrambling ahead of them trying to look like Moses on his way out of Egypt. Such a leader will send up a trial balloon and then boldly set out in the direction of the wind, doing his best to create the impression that the wind consulted him before it started to blow.\r\n<p>If this sounds harsh, let me insist that it is far short of the fact. Every city has its religious leader who enjoys a wide reputation as a prominent churchman but who never takes a position on anything until he has first read up on public opinion and is reasonably sure that he will be siding with the majority, or at least with the important minority. Such a man is a hireling and will be judged and disposed of as a hireling in the day of Christ.\r\n<p>We should pray that the Lord would send us leaders; and then we should pray for those leaders when they appear.','Romans 12:6, 8','We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. . . .

Worship is pure or base as the worshiper entertains high or low thoughts of God\r\n<p>For this reason the gravest question before the Church is always God Himself, and the most portentous fact about any man is not what he at a given time may say or do, but what he in his deep heart conceives God to be like. We tend by a secret law of the soul to move toward our mental image of God. This is true not only of the individual Christian, but of the company of Christians that composes the Church. Always the most revealing thing about the Church is its idea of God, just as its most significant message is what it says about Him or leaves unsaid, for its silence is often more eloquent than its speech. It can never escape the self-disclosure of its witness concerning God','Psalm 89:8','O Lord God Almighty, who is like you? / You are mighty, O Lord, and your faithfulness surrounds you','The most portentous fact about us is not what we, at any given time, may say or do, but what in our hearts we conceive God to be like.','Father, give us your grace to know You as You truly are, so that we may love and praise You as You deserve.'),(1299,'The Knowledge of the Holy','1','Why We Must Think Rightly about God',NULL,'The Mightiest Thought the Mind Can Entertain','Were we able to extract from any man a complete answer to the question, \"What comes into your mind when you think about God?\" we might predict with certainty the spiritual future of that man.

Thought and speech are God\'s gifts to creatures made in His image; there are intimately associated with Him and impossible apart from Him. It is highly significant that the first word was the Word: \"And the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" We may speak because God spoke. In Him word and idea are indivisible.\r\n<p>That our idea of God correspond as nearly as possible to the true being of God is of immense importance to us. Compared with our actual thoughts about Him, our creedal statements are of little consequence. Our real idea of God may lie buried under the rubbish of conventional religious notions and may require an intelligent and vigorous search before it is finally unearthed and exposed for what it is. Only after an ordeal of painful self-probing are we likely to discover what we actually believe about God.\r\n<p>A right conception of God is basic not only to systematic theology but to practical Christian living as well. It is to worship what the foundation is to the temple; where it is inadequate or out of plumb the whole structure must sooner or later collapse. I believe there is scarcely an error in doctrine or a failure in applying Christian ethics that cannot be traced finally to imperfect and ignoble thoughts about God.','John 1:1','In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.','Our failure in believing rightly about God and in applying His ideals in our lives comes from our imperfect thoughts about Him.','Lord, sweep aside our false conceptions of You and replace them with true thoughts of who You are.'),(1300,'The Knowledge of the Holy','1','Why We Must Think Rightly about God',NULL,'A Right Belief about God','It is my opinion that the Christian conception of God current in these middle years of the 20th century is so decadent as to be utterly beneath the dignity of the Most High God and actually to constitute for professed believers something amounting to a moral calamity.\r\n<p>All the problems of heaven and earth, though they were to confront us together and at once, would be nothing compared with the overwhelming problem of God: That He is; what He is like; and what we as moral being must do about Him.\r\n<p>The man who comes to a right belief about God is relieved of 10,000 temporal problems, for he sees at once that these have to do with matters that at the most cannot concern him for very long; but even if the multiple burdens of time may be lifted from him, the one mighty single burden of eternity begins to press down upon him with a weight more crushing than all the woes of the world piled one upon another. That mighty burden is his obligation to God. It includes an instant and lifelong duty to love God with every power of mind and soul, to obey Him perfectly, and to worship Him acceptably. And when the man\'s laboring conscience tells him that he has done none of these things, but has from childhood been guilty of foul revolts against the Majesty in the heavens, the inner pressure of self-accusation may become too heavy to bear.\r\n<p>The gospel can lift this destroying burden from the mind, give beauty for ashes, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. But unless the weight of the burden is felt, the gospel can mean nothing to the man; and until he sees a vision of God high and lifted up, there will be no woe and no burden. Low views of God destroy the gospel for all who hold them.','Isaiah 6:1','I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.','Until we see a vision of God high and lifted up, we will not sense the burden of our obligation to God.','Is our view of You, Father, too low?

Always this god will conform to the image of the one who created it and will be base or pure, cruel or kind, according to the moral state of the mind from which it emerges.\r\n<p>A god begotten in the shadows of a fallen heart will quite naturally be no true likeness of the true God. \"Thou thoughtest,\" said the Lord to the wicked man in the psalm, \"that I was altogether such an one as thyself.\" Surely this must be a serious affront to the Most High God before whom cherubim and seraphim continually do cry, \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth.\"\r\n<p>Let us beware lest we in our pride accept the erroneous notion that idolatry consists only in kneeling before visible objects of adoration, and that civilized peoples are therefore free from it. The essence of idolatry is the entertainment of thoughts about God that are unworthy of Him. It beings in the mind and may be present where no overt act of worship has taken place. \"When they knew God,\" wrote Paul, \"they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\"\r\n<p>Then followed the worship of idols fashioned after the likeness of men and birds and beasts and creeping things. But this series of degrading acts began in the mind. Wrong ideas about God are only the fountain from which the polluted waters of idolatry flow; they are themselves idolatrous.

The first step down for any church is taken when it surrenders its high opinion of God.\r\n<p>Before the Christian Church goes into eclipse anywhere, there must be a corrupting of its simple basic theology. It simple gets a wrong answer to the question, \"What is God like?\" and goes on from here. Though she may continue to cling to a sound nominal creed, its practical working creed has become false. The masses of her adherents come to believe that God is different from what He actually is; and that is heresy of the most insidious and deadly kind.\r\n<p>The heaviest obligation lying upon the Christian Church today is to purify and elevate its concept of God until it is once more worthy of Him&#151;and of it. In all its prayers and labors, this should have first place.

Yet at the outset I must acknowledge that it cannot be answered except to say that God is not like anything; that is, He is not exactly like anything or anybody.\r\n<p>We learn by using what we already know as a bridge over which we pass to the unknown. It is not possible for the mind to crash suddenly past the familiar into the totally unfamiliar. Even the most vigorous and daring mind is unable to create something out of nothing by a spontaneous act of imagination. Those strange beings that populate the world of mythology and superstition are not pure creations of fancy. The imagination created them by taking ordinary inhabitants of earth and air and sea and extending their familiar forms beyond their normal boundaries, or by mixing the forms of two or more so as to produce something new. However beautiful or grotesque these may be, their prototypes can always be identified. They are like something we already know.\r\n<p>The effort of inspired men to express the ineffable has placed a great strain upon both thought and language in the Holy Scriptures. These being often a revelation of a world above nature, the writers are compelled to use a great many \"like\" words to make themselves understood.','Psalm 17:15','And I&#151;in righteousness I will see your face; / when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.','Human words and thoughts lack the exactness, the preciseness to describe what God is like; there is an existence beyond the human one that cannot be captured in our language.','Holy Father, let us be satisfied with seeing your likeness, with understanding as much as we can about what you are like.'),(1304,'The Knowledge of the Holy','2','God Incomprehensible',NULL,'That-Which-Is-God','When the Spirit would acquaint us with something that lies beyond the field of our knowledge, He tells us that <i>this</i> thing is <i>like</i> something we already know, but He is always careful to phrase His description so as to save us from slavish literalism. For example, when the prophet Ezekiel saw heaven opened and beheld visions of God, he found himself looking at that which he had no language to describe. What he was seeing was wholly different from anything he had ever know before, so he fell back upon the language of resemblance. \"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire.\"\r\n<p>The nearer he approaches to the burning throne, the less sure his words become: \"And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it. . . . This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.\"\r\n<p>Strange as this language is, it still does not create the impression of unreality. One gathers that the whole scene is very real but entirely alien to anything men know on earth. So, in order to convey the idea of what he sees, the prophet must employ such words as \"likeness,\" \"appearance,\" \"as it were,\" and \"the likeness of appearance.\" Even the throne becomes \"the appearnce of a throne\" and He that sits upon it, though like a man, is so <i>unlike</i> one that He can be described only as \"the likeness of the appearance of a man.\"\r\n<p>When the Scripture states that man was made in the image of God, we dare not add  to that statement an idea from our own head and make it mean \"in the <i>exact</i> image.\" To do so is to make man a replica of God, and that is to lose the unicity of God and end with no God at all. It is to break down the wall, infinitely high, that separates That-which-is-God from that-which-is-not-God. To think of creature and Creator as alike in essential being is to rob God of most of His attributes and reduce Him to the status of a creature. It is, for instance, to rob Him of His infinitude: there cannot be two unlimited substances in the universe. It is to take away His sovereignty: there cannot be two absolutely free beings in the universe, for sooner or later two completely free wills must collide. These attributes, to mention no more, require that there be but one to whom they belong.','Ezekiel 1:13','The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches.','There cannot be two absolutely free beings in the universe. If that were true, then our wills would have as much authority as God’s, and that cannot happen.

But even here and now, whenever the heart begins to burn with a desire for God, it is made able to receive the uncreated light and, inspired and fulfilled by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, it tastes the joys of heaven. It transcends all visible things and is raised to the sweetness of eternal life. . . . Herein truly is perfect love; when all the intent of the mind, all the secret working of the heart, is lifted up into the love of God.\"','Psalm 42:7','Deep calls to deep / in the roar of your waterfalls; / all your waves and breakers / have swept over me.','Even though we can never comprehend God in all that He is, occasionally, when our hearts burn with a desire for Him, the Holy Spirit enables us to taste a bit of the joys of heaven.','We praise you Father for sending Jesus Christ to show us what You are like&#151;not to reason, of course, but to faith and love.'),(1308,'The Knowledge of the Holy','2','God Incomprehensible',NULL,'\"Sunshine to the Heart\"','That God can be known by the soul in tender personal experience while remaining infinitely aloof from the curious eyes of reason constitutes a paradox best described as<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness to the intellect<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sunshine to the heart.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederick W. Faber<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe author of the celebrated little work <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i> develops this thesis throughout his book. In approaching God, he says, the seeker discovers that the divine Being dwells in obscurity, hidden behind a cloud of unknowing; nevertheless, he should not be discouraged but set his will with a naked intent unto God. This cloud is between the seeker and God so that he may never see God clearly by the light of understanding nor feel Him in the emotions. But by the mercy of God faith can break through into His Presence if the seeker but believe the Word and press on.','1 Corinthians 13:8','Where there is knowledge, it will pass away','We will never know God by reasoning about what He is like, but we may know Him through a relationship with Him by His Son, Jesus Christ.','Father God, we pray to know You not by the light of understanding or emotions but by faith.'),(1309,'The Knowledge of the Holy','2','God Incomprehensible',NULL,'Let Us Love God as He Is in Himself','Michael de Molinos, the Spanish saint, taught the same thing. In his <i>Spiritual Guide</i> he says that God will take the soul by the hand and lead her through the way of pure faith, \"and causing the understanding to leave behind all considerations and reasonings He draws her forward. . . . Thus He causes her by means of a simple and obscure knowledge of faith to aspire only to her Bridegroom upon the wings of love.\"\r\n<p>For these and similar teachings,  Molinos was condemned as a heretic by the Inquisition and sentenced to life imprisonment. He soon died in prison, but the truth he taught can never die. Speaking of the Christian soul he says: \"Let her suppose that all the whole world and the most-refined conceptions of the wisest intellects can tell her nothing, and that the goodness and beauty of her Beloved infinitely surpass all their knowledge, being persuaded that all creatures are too rude to inform her and to conduct her to the true knowledge of God. . . . She ought then to go forward with her love, leaving all her understanding behind. Let her love God as He is in Himself, and not as her imagination says He is, and pictures Him.\"\r\n<p>\"What is God like?\" If by that question we mean \"What is God like <i>in Himself</i>?\" there is no answer. If we mean \"What has God disclosed <i>about Himself<i> that the reverent reason can comprehend?\" there is, I believe, an answer both full and satisfying. For while the name of God is secret and His essential nature incomprehensible, He in condescending love has by revelation declared certain things to be true of Himself.

Faber<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem to be necessary before proceeding further to define the word <i>attribute</i> as it is used in this volume. It is not used in its philosophical sense nor confined to its strictest theological meaning. By it is meant simply whatever may be correctly ascribed to God. For the purpose of this book, <i>an attribute of God is whatever God has in any way revealed as being true to Himself.</i>','Psalm 42:2','My soul thirsts for God, for the living God, so my soul pants for you, O God.','Nothing should be more joyful for a Christian than for him or her to contemplate the attributes of God.','Lord, help us to delight in what You have revealed to us about Yourself.'),(1311,'The Knowledge of the Holy','3','A Divine Attribute: Something True about God',NULL,'A Thousand Attributes','And this brings us to the question of the number of the divine attributes. Religious thinkers have differed about this. Some have insisted that there are seven, but Faber sang of the \"God of a <i>thousand</i> attributes,\" and Charles Wesley exclaimed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad thine attributes confess,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious all and <i>numberless</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, these men were worshiping, not counting; but we might be wise to follow the insight of the enraptured heart rather than the more cautious reasonings of the theological mind. If an attribute is something that is true of God, we may as well not try to enumerate them. Furthermore, to this meditation on the being of God the number of the attributes is not important, for only a limited few will be mentioned here.\r\n<p>If an attribute is something true of God, it is also something that we can <i>conceive</i> as being true of Him. God, being infinite, must possess attributes about which we can know nothing. An attribute, as we can know it, is a mental concept, an intellectual response to God\'s self-revelation. It is an answer to a question, the reply God makes to our interrogation concerning Himself.','Psalm 31:5','Into your hands I commit my spirit, redeem me, O Lord, the God of Truth.','God\'s attributes point us to what He is like and answer our questions concerning His nature.','Father, help not to question about how many attributes You might possess. Instead, help us to relish the notion that we can know a bit of Your nature.'),(1312,'The Knowledge of the Holy','3','A Divine Attribute: Something True about God',NULL,'God Has Provided Answers','What is God like? What kind of God is He? How may we expect Him to act toward us and toward all created things? Such questions are not merely academic. They touch the far-in reaches of the human spirit, and their answers affect life and character and destiny. When asked in reverence and their answers sought in humility, these are questions that cannot but be pleasing to our Father which art in heaven. \"For he willeth that we be occupied in knowing and loving,\" wrote Julian of Norwich, \"till the time that we shall be fulfilled in heaven. . . . For of all things the beholding and the loving of the Maker maketh the soul to seem less in his own sigh, and most filleth him with reverent dread and true meekness; with plenty of charity for his fellow Christians.\"\r\n<p>To our questions God has provided answers; not all the answers, certainly, but enough to satisfy our intellects and ravish our hearts. These answers He has provided in nature, in the Scriptures, and in the person of His Son.\r\n<p>The idea that God reveals Himself in the creation is not held with much vigor by modern Christians; but it is, nevertheless, set forth in the inspired Word, especially in the writings of David and Isaiah in the Old Testament and in Paul\'s Epistle to the Romans in the New. In the Holy Scriptures the revelation is clearer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavens declare Thy glory, Lord,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every star Thy wisdom shines;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when our eyes behold Thy Word,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read Thy name in fairer lines.<br>\r\nIsaac Watts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it is a sacred and indispensable part of the Christian message that the full sun-blaze of revelation came at the incarnation when the Eternal Word became flesh to dwell among us.','Psalm 19:1','The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.','God graciously provides answers enough to satisfy our intellects in His creation, in His Word, and in His Son.','Father, we praise Your name and rejoice with Your creation, with the skies, the stars, and the sun as they proclaim Your glory.'),(1313,'The Knowledge of the Holy','3','A Divine Attribute: Something True about God',NULL,'Creator and Created','Though God in this threefold revelation has provided answers to our questions concerning Him, the answers by no means lie on the surface. They must be sought by prayer, by long meditation on the written Word, and by earnest and well-disciplined labor. However brightly the light may shine, it can be seen only by those who are spiritually prepared to receive it. \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"\r\n<p>If we would think accurately about the attributes of God, we must learn to reject certain words that are sure to come crowding into our minds&#151;such words as <i>trait, characteristic, quality</i>&#151;words which are proper and necessary when we are considering created beings but altogether inappropriate when we are thinking about God. We must break ourselves of the habit of thinking of the Creator as we think of His creatures. It is probably impossible to think without words, but if we permit ourselves to think with the wrong words, we shall soon be entertaining erroneous thoughts; for words, which are given us for the expression of thought, have a habit of going beyond their proper bounds and determining the content of thought. \"As nothing is more easy than to think,\" says Thomas Traherne, \"so nothing is more difficult than to think well.\" If we ever think well, it should be when we think of God.\r\n<p>A man if the sum of his parts and his character the sum of the traits that compose it. These traits vary from man to man and may from time to time vary from themselves within the same man. Human character is not constant because the traits or qualities that constitute it are unstable. These come and go, burn low or glow with great intensity throughout our lives. Thus a man who is kind and considerate at 30 may be cruel and churlish at 50. Such a change is possible because man is <i>made</i>; he is in a very real sense a composition; he is the sum of the traits that make up his character.','Matthew 5:8','\"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.\"','Changes in our character are possible because we are created beings; God’s character is constant and unchanging because He is the Creator.','Lord, help us to think well when we think of You.'),(1314,'The Knowledge of the Holy','3','A Divine Attribute: Something True about God',NULL,'The Father Is Made of None','We naturally and correctly think of man as a work wrought by the divine Intelligence. He is both created and made. How he was created lies undisclosed among the secrets of God; how he was brought from not-being to being, from no-thing to something is not known and may never be known to any but the One who brought him forth. How God <i>made</i> him, however, is less of a secret, and while we know only a small portion of the whole truth, we do know that man possesses a body, a soul, and a spirit; we know that he has memory, reason, will, intelligence, sensation, and we know that to give these meaning he has the wondrous gift of consciousness. We know, too, that these, together with various qualities of temperament, compose his total human self. These are gifts from God arranged by infinite wisdom, notes that make up the score of creation’s loftiest symphony, threads that compose the master tapestry of the universe.\r\n<p>But in all this we are thinking creature-thoughts and using creature-words to express them. Neither such thoughts nor such words are appropriate to the Deity. \"The Father is made of none,\" says the Athanasian Creed, \"neither created nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and the Son: not made nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.\" God exists in Himself and of Himself. His being he owes to no one. His substance is indivisible. He has no parts but is single in His unitary being.\r\n<p>The doctrine of the divine unity means not only that there is but one God; it means also that God is simple, uncomplex, one with Himself. The harmony of His being is the result not of a perfect balance of parts but of the absence of parts. Between His attributes no contradiction can exist. He need not suspend one to exercise another, for in Him all His attributes are one. All of God does all that God does; He does not divide Himself to perform a work, but works in the total unity of His being.','Psalm 139:6','Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.','Our creature-thoughts and our creature-words are inappropriate for expressing what the Creator is like. God is neither created nor begotten, but He exists in Himself and of Himself.','Can we ever understand what You are like, Father? Help us to embrace the truth of the divine unity.'),(1315,'The Knowledge of the Holy','3','A Divine Attribute: Something True about God',NULL,'What God Is','An attribute, then, is not a part of God. It is <i>how</i> God is, and as far as the reasoning mind can go, we may say that it is <i>what</i> God is, though, as I have tried to explain, exactly what He is He cannot tell us. Of what God is conscious when He is conscious of self, only He knows. \"The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.\" Only to an equal could God communicate the mystery of His Godhead; and to think of God as having an equal is to fall into an intellectual absurdity.\r\n<p>The divine attributes are what we know to be true of God. He does not posses them as qualities; they are how God is as He reveals Himself to His creatures. Love, for instance, is not something God has and which may grow or diminish or cease to be. His love is the way God is, and when He loves, He is simply being Himself.

Before that burning bush, we ask not to understand, but only that we may fitly adore Thee, One God in Persons Three. Amen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo meditate on the three Persons of the Godhead is to walk in thought through the garden eastward in Eden and to tread on holy ground. Our sincerest effort to grasp the incomprehensible mystery of the Trinity must remain forever futile, and only by deepest reverence can it be saved from actual presumption.\r\n<p>Some persons who reject all they cannot explain have denied that God is a Trinity. Subjecting the Most High to their cold, level-eyed scrutiny, they conclude that it is impossible that He could be both One and Three. These forget that their whole life is enshrouded in mystery. They fail to consider that any real explanation of even the simplest phenomenon in nature lies hidden in obscurity and can no more be explained than can the mystery of the Godhead.\r\n<p>Every man lives by faith, the nonbeliever as well as the saint; the one by faith in natural laws and the other by faith in God. Every man throughout his entire life constantly accepts without understanding. The most learned sage can be reduced to silence with one simple question, <i>What?</i> The answer to that question lies forever in the abyss of unknowing beyond any man’s ability to discover. \"God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof,\" but mortal man never.','Job 36:26','How great is God&#151;beyond our understanding!

With the free, open sense of a child, yet with the ripe faculty of a man, his whole heart would be kindled by that sight. . . . This green flowery rock-built earth, the trees, the mountains, rivers, many-sounding seas; that great deep sea of azure that swims overhead; the winds sweeping through it; the black cloud fashioning itself together, now pouring out fire, now hail and rain; what <i>is</i> it? Ay, what? At bottom we do not yet know; we can never know at all.\"\r\n<p>How different are we who have grown used to it, who have become jaded with a satiety of wonder. \"It is not by our superior insight that we escape the difficulty,\" says Carlyle, \"it is by our superior levity, our inattention, our <i>want</i> of insight. It is by <i>not</i> thinking that we cease to wonder at it. . . . We call that fire of the black thundercloud \'electricity,\' and lecture learnedly about it, and grind the like of it out of glass and silk: but what <i>is</i> it? Whence comes it? Whither goes it? Science has done much for us; but it is a poor science that would hide from us the great deep sacred infinitude of Nescience, whither we can never penetrate, on which all science swims as a mere superficial film. This world, after all our science and sciences, is still a miracle; wonderful, inscrutable, magical and more, to whosoever will <i>think</i> of it.\"\r\n<p>These penetrating, almost prophetic, words were written more than a century ago, but not all the breath-taking advances of science and technology since that time have invalidated one word or rendered obsolete as much as one period or comma. Still we do not know. We save face by repeating frivolously the popular jargon of science. We harness the mighty energy that rushes through our world; we subject it to fingertip control in our cars and our kitchens; we make it work for us like Aladdin\'s jinn, but still we do not know what it is. Secularism, materialism, and the intrusive presence of <i>things</i> have put out the light in our souls and turned us into a generation of zombies. We cover our deep ignorance with words, but we are ashamed to wonder, we are afraid to whisper \"mystery.\"','Ecclesiastes 11:5','As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother’s womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.','Secularism, materialism, and the intrusive presence of things in our lives have snuffed out the light in our souls and turned us into a generation of zombies.','Lord, help to never be ashamed to wonder, to be afraid to utter the word, mystery.'),(1318,'The Knowledge of the Holy','4','The Holy Trinity',NULL,'A Contradiction of Terms','<p>The Church has not hesitated to teach the doctrine of the Trinity. Without pretending to understand, it has given its witness, it has repeated what the Holy Scriptures teach. Some deny that the Scriptures teach the Trinity of the Godhead on the ground that the whole idea of trinity in unity is a contradiction in terms; but since we cannot understand the fall of a leaf by the roadside or the hatching of a robin’s egg in the nest yonder, why should the Trinity be a problem to us? \"We think more loftily of God,\" says Michael de Molinos, \"by knowing that He is incomprehensible, and above our understanding, than by conceiving Him under any image, and creature beauty, according to our rude understanding.\"\r\n<p>Not all who called themselves Christians through the centuries were Trinitarians, but as the presence of God in the fiery pillar glowed above the camp of Israel throughout the wilderness journey, saying to all the world, \"These are My people,\" so belief in the Trinity has since the days of the apostles shone above the Church of the Firstborn as it journeyed down the years. Purity and power have followed this faith. Under this banner have gone forth apostles, fathers, martyrs, mystics, hymnists, reformers, revivalists, and the seal of divine approval has rested on their lives and their labors. However they may have differed on minor matters, the doctrine of the Trinity bound them together.','Exodus 13:21','By day the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.','Trinity in unity is not a contradiction in terms for those who think lofty thoughts of God. He is incomprehensible, above our understanding.','Faithful Father, show each of us that the doctrine of the Trinity binds us together with our fellow Christians.'),(1319,'The Knowledge of the Holy','4','The Holy Trinity',NULL,'Incredible and Impossible','<p>What God declares the believing heart confesses without the need of further proof. Indeed, to seek proof is to admit doubt, and to obtain proof is to render faith superfluous. Everyone who possesses the gift of faith will recognize the wisdom of those daring words of one of the early Church fathers: \"I believe that Christ died for me because it is incredible; I believe that He rose from the dead because it is impossible.\"\r\n<p>That was the attitude of Abraham, who against all evidence waxed strong in faith, giving glory to God. It was the attitude of Anselm, \"the second Augustine,\" one of the greatest thinkers of the Christian era, who held that faith must precede all effort to understand. Reflection upon revealed truth naturally follows the advent of faith, but faith comes first to the hearing ear, not to the cogitating mind. The believing man does not ponder the Word and arrive at faith by a process of reasoning, nor does he seek confirmation of faith from philosophy or science. His cry is, \"O earth, earth, hear the world of the Lord. Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar.\"\r\n<p>Is this to dismiss scholarship as valueless in the sphere of revealed religion? By no means. The scholar has a vitally important task to perform within a carefully prescribed precinct. His task is to guarantee the purity of the text, to get as close as possible to the Word as originally given. He may compare Scripture with Scripture until he has discovered the true meaning of the text. But right there his authority ends. <i>He must never sit in judgment upon what is written.</i> He dare not bring the meaning of the Word before the bar of his reason. He dare not commend or condemn the Word as reasonable or unreasonable, scientific or unscientific. After the meaning is discovered, that meaning judges him; never does he judge it.\r\n<p>The doctrine of the Trinity is truth for the heart. The spirit of man alone can enter through the veil and penetrate into that Holy of Holies. \"Let me speak Thee in longing,\" pleaded Anselm, \"let me long for Thee in seeking; let me find Thee in love, and love Thee in finding.\" Love and faith are at home in the mystery of the Godhead. Let reason kneel in reverence outside.','Hebrews 11:8','By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.','Faith does not follow deep mental work or reasoning. No, faith precedes all effort to understand.','Lord, enlighten our understanding a bit so that we realize that we can never arrive at faith by reasoning, nor from philosophy, nor science.'),(1320,'The Knowledge of the Holy','4','The Holy Trinity',NULL,'Jesus and the Father Are One','<p>Christ did not hesitate to use the plural form when speaking of Himself along with the Father and the Spirit. \"We will come unto him and make our abode with him.\" Yet again He said, \"I and my Father are one.\" It is most important that we think of God as Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance. Only so may we think rightly of God and in a manner worthy of Him and of our own souls.\r\n<p>It was our Lord\'s claim to equality with the Father that outraged the religionists of His day and led at last to His crucifixion. The attack on the doctrine of the Trinity two centuries later by Arius and others was also aimed at Christ\'s claim to deity. During the Arian controversy, 318 Church fathers (many of them maimed and scarred by the physical violence suffered in earlier persecutions) met at Nicaea and adopted a statement of faith, one section of which runs:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Only-begotten Son of God,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begotten of Him before all ages,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of God, Light of Light,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very God of Very God,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begotten, not made,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being of one substance with the Father,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By whom all things were made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor more than 1,600 years, this has stood as the final test of orthodoxy, as well it should, for it condenses in theological language the teaching of the New Testament concerning the position of the Son in the Godhead.','John 10:29&#150;30','\"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them from out of my Father’s had. I and the Father are one.\"','We can only think rightly of You, Father, and in a manner worthy of You, when we think of the Trinity in Unity.','Help us, too, Father, to adopt a statement of faith that declares Christ as Very God of Very God.'),(1321,'The Knowledge of the Holy','4','The Holy Trinity',NULL,'Three Person, Coeternal, Together and Equal','The Nicene Creed also pays tribute to the Holy Spirit as being Himself God and equal to the Father and the Son:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in the Holy Spirit<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord and giver of life,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which proceedeth from the Father and the Son,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who with the Father and Son together<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is worshipped and glorified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from the question of whether the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone or from the Father and the Son, this tenet of the ancient creed has been held by the Eastern and Western branches of the Church and by all but a tiny minority of Christians.\r\n<p>The authors of the Athanasian Creed spelled out with great care the relation of the three Persons to each other, filling in the gaps in human thought as far as they were able while staying within the bounds of the inspired Word. \"In this Trinity,\" runs the Creed, \"nothing is before or after, nothing is greater or less: but all three Persons coeternal, together and equal.\"\r\n<p>How do these words harmonize with the saying of Jesus, \"My Father is greater than I\"? Those old theologians knew, and wrote into the Creed, \"Equal to His Father, as touching His Godhead; less than the Father, as touching His manhood,\"and this interpretation commends itself to every serious-minded seeker after truth in a region where the light is all but blinding.\r\n<p>To redeem mankind the Eternal Son did not leave the bosom of the Father; while walking among men He referred to Himself as \"the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the Father,\" and spoke of Himself again as \"the Son of man which is in heaven.\" We grant mystery here, but not confusion. In His incarnation the Son veiled His deity, but He did not void it. The unity of the Godhead made it impossible that He should surrender anything of His deity. When He took upon Him the nature of man, He did not degrade Himself or become even for a time less than he had been before. God can never become less than Himself. For God to become anything that He has not been is unthinkable.','John 14:28','\"You heard me say, \'I am going away and I am coming back to you.\' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.\"','Even though Christ became a man and lived on earth in human form, He never left the Father’s presence in heaven.','Father, we stand in awe of the three Person Godhead, we rejoice in the knowledge that Jesus is one with the Father.'),(1322,'The Knowledge of the Holy','4','The Holy Trinity',NULL,'Instant, Immediate Communion','The Persons of the Godhead, being one, have one will. They work always together, and never one smallest act is done by one without the instant acquiescence of the other two. Every act of god is accomplished by the Trinity in Unity. Here, of course, we are being driven by necessity to conceive of God in human terms. We are thinking of God by analogy with man, and the result must fall short of ultimate truth; yet if we are to think of God at all, we must do it by adapting creature-thoughts and creature-words to the Creator. It is a real if understandable error to conceive of the Persons of the Godhead as conferring with one another and reaching agreement by interchange of thought as humans do. It has always seemed to me that Milton introduces an element of weakness into his celebrated <i>Paradise Lost</i> when he presents the Persons of the Godhead conversing with each other about the redemption of the human race.\r\n<p>When the Son of God walked the earth as the Son of Man, He spoke often to the Father and the Father answered Him again; as the Son of Man, He now intercedes with God for His people. The dialogue involving the Father and the Son recorded in the Scriptures is always to be understood as being between the Eternal Father and the Man Christ Jesus. That instant, immediate communion between the Persons of the Godhead that has been from all eternity knows not sound nor effort nor motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the eternal silences<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God’s endless Word was spoken;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None heard but He who always spake,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the silence was unbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O marvellous!

This is partly true but not wholly so, for God cannot so divide Himself that one Person works while another is inactive. In the Scriptures the three Persons are shown to act in harmonious unity in all the mighty works that are wrought throughout the universe.\r\n<p>In the Holy Scriptures the work of <i>creation</i> is attributed to the Father (Genesis 1:1), to the Son (Colossians 1:16), and to the Holy Spirit (Job 26:13 and Psalm 104:30). The <i>incarnation</i> is shown to have been accomplished by the three Persons in full accord (Luke 1:35), though only the Son became flesh to dwell among us. At Christ’s <i>baptism</i> the Son came up out of the water, the Spirit descended upon Him and the Father’s voice spoke from heaven (Matthew 3:16&#150;17). Probably the most beautiful description of the work of <i>atonement</i> is found in Hebrews 9:14, where it is stated that Christ, through the Eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God; and there we behold the three Persons operating together.\r\n<p>The <i>resurrection</i> of Christ is likewise attributed variously to the Father (Acts 2:32), to the Son (John 10:17&#150;18), and to the Holy Spirit (Romans 1:4). The <i>salvation</i> of the individual man is shown by the apostle Peter to be the work of all three Persons of the Godhead (1 Peter 1:2), and the <i>indwelling</i> of the Christian man’s soul is said to by the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (John 14:15&#150;23).\r\n<p>The doctrine of the Trinity, as I have said before, is truth for the heart.

Aside from God, nothing is self-caused.\r\n<p>By our effort to discover the origin of things, we confess our belief that everything was made by Someone who was made of none. By familiar experience we are taught that everything \"came from\" something else.

Any person or thing may be at once both caused and the cause of someone or something else; and so, back to the One who is the cause of all but is Himself caused by none.','Revelation 11:17','\"We give thanks to you, Lord God Almight, / the One who is and who as, / because you have taken your great power / and have begun to reign.\"','God\'s nature, the fact that He has no origin, is that which sets Him apart from everything that is not God.','Father, can we ever understand Your majesty, Your self-existence?

Already the concept of cause and source and origin is firmly fixed in his mind. He knows that everything around him came from something other than itself, and he simply extends that concept upward to God. The little philospher is thinking in true creature-idiom and, allowing for his lack of basic information, he is reasoning correctly. He must be told that God has no origin, and he will find this hard to grasp because it introduces a category with which he is wholly unfamiliar and contradicts the bent toward origin-seeking so deeply ingrained in all intelligent beings, a bent that propels them to probe ever back and back toward undiscovered beginnings.\r\n<p>To think steadily of that to which the idea of origin cannot apply is not easy, if indeed it is possible at all. Just as under certain conditions a tiny point of light can be seen, not be looking directly at it but by focusing the eyes slightly to one side, so it is with the idea of the Uncreated. When we try to focus our thought upon One who is pure uncreated being, we may see nothing at all, for He dwelleth in light that no man can approach unto. Only by faith and love are we able to glimpse Him as he passes by our shelter in the cleft of the rock. \"And although this knowledge is very cloudy, vague and general,\" says Michael de Molinos, \"yet, being supernatural, it produces far more clear and perfect cognition of God than any sensible or particular apprehension that can be formed in this life; because all corporeal and sensible images are immeasurably remote from God.\"\r\n<p>The human mind, being created, has an understandable uneasiness about the Uncreated. We do not find it comfortable to allow for the presence of One who is wholly outside of the circle of our familiar knowledge. We tend to be disquieted by the thought of One who does not account to us for His being, who is responsible to no one, who is self-existent, self-independent, and self-sufficient.','Exodus 33:21&#150;23','Then the Lord said, \"There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.

To admit that there is One who lies beyond us, who exists outside of all our categories, who will not be dismissed with a name, who will not appear before the bar of our reason, nor submit to our curious inquiries: this requires a great deal of humility, more than most of us possess, so we save face by thinking God down to our level, or at least down to where we can manage Him.

We prefer to think where it will do more good&#151;about how to build a better mousetrap, for instance, or how to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before.

Some knowledge of what kind of God it is that operates the universe is indispensable to a sound philosophy of life and a sane outlook on the world scene. The much-quoted advice of Alexander Pope,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnow then thyself, presume not God to scan:<br>\r\nThe proper study of mankind is man,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nif followed literally would destroy any possibility of man\'s ever knowing himself in any but the most superficial way. We can never know who or what we are till we know at least something of what God is. For this reason the self-existence of God is not a wisp of dry doctrine, academic and remote; it is in fact as near as our breath and as practical as the latest surgical technique.\r\n<p>For reasons known only to Himself, God honored man above all other beings by creating him in His own image. And let it be understood that the divine image in man is not a poetic fancy, not an idea born of religious longing. It is a solid theological fact, taught plainly throughout the Sacred Scriptures and recognized by the Church as a truth necessary to a right understanding of the Christian faith.','Genesis 1:27','So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.','We can never really know who we are until we know something of who God is.','Lord God, help us to fully grasp the concept of your self-existence, to move beyond a dry doctrinal knowledge of that fact and to embrace it with our whole beings.'),(1328,'The Knowledge of the Holy','5','The Self-existence of God',NULL,'The Original Voice','Man is a created being, a derived and contingent self, who of himself possesses nothing but is dependent each moment for his existence upon the One who created him after His won likeness. The fact of God is necessary to the fact of man. Think God away, and man has no ground of existence.\r\n<p>That God is everything and man nothing is a basic tenet of Christian faith and devotion; and here the teachings of Christianity coincide with those of the more advanced and philosophical religions of the East. Man for all his genius is but an echo of the original Voice, a reflection of the uncreated Light. As a sunbeam perishes when cut off from the sun, so man apart from God would pass back into the void of nothingness from which he first leaped at the creative call.\r\n<p>Not man only, but everything that exists came out of and is dependent upon the continuing creative impulse. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. . . . All things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made.\" That is how John explains it, and with him agrees the apostle Paul: \"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.\" To this witness the writer to the Hebrews adds his voice, testifying of Christ that He is the brightness of God\'s glory and the express image of His Person, and He upholds all things by the word of His power.','Colossians 1:16','For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.','Man is nothing; God is everything.

You uphold all things by the world of Your power.'),(1329,'The Knowledge of the Holy','5','The Self-existence of God',NULL,'The Central Sun','In this utter dependence of all things upon the creative will of God lies the possibility for both holiness and sin. One of the marks of God\'s image in man is his ability to exercise moral choice. The teaching of Christianity is that man chose to be independent of God and confirmed his choice by deliberately disobeying a divine command. This act violated the relationship that normally existed between God and His creature; it rejected God as the ground of existence and threw man back upon himself. Thereafter he became not a planet revolving around the central Sun, but a sun in his own right, around which everything else must evolve.\r\n<p>A more positive assertion of selfhood could not be imagined than those words of god to Moses: I AM THAT I AM. Everything God is, everything that is God, is set forth in that unqualified declaration of independent being. Yet in God, self is not sin but the quintessence of all possible goodness, holiness, and truth.\r\n<p>The natural man is a sinner because and only because he challenges God’s selfhood in relation to his own. In all else he may willingly accept the sovereignty of God; in his own life he rejects it. For him, God\'s dominion ends where his begins. For him, self becomes Self, and in this he unconsciously imitates Lucifer, that fallen son of the morning who said in his hear, \"I will ascent into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. . . . I will be like the Most High.\"\r\n<p>Yet so subtle is self that scarcely anyone is conscious of its presence. Because man is born a rebel, he is unaware that he is one. His constant assertion of self, as far as he thinks of it at all, appears to him a perfectly normal thing. He is willing to share himself, sometimes even to sacrifice himself for a desired end, but never to dethrone himself. No matter how far down the scale of social acceptance he may slide, he is still in his own eyes a king on a throne, and no one, not even God, can take that throne from him.','Psalm 84:11','For the Lord God is a sun and shield; / the Lord bestows favor and honor; / no good thing does he withhold / from those whose walk is blameless.','Our constant assertion of self, as far as we ever think about it, appears to us as a perfectly normal thing.

A moral being, created to worship before the throne of God, sits on the throne of his own selfhood and from that elevated position declares, \"I AM.\" That is sin in its concentrated essence; yet because it is natural it appears to be good. It is only when in the gospel the soul is brought before the face of the Most Holy One without the protective shield of ignorance that the frightful moral incongruity is brought home to the conscience. In the language of evangelism the man who is thus confronted by the fiery presence of Almighty God is said to be under conviction. Christ referred to this when He said of the Spirit whom He would send to the world, \"And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.\"\r\n<p>The earliest fulfillment of these words of Christ was at Pentecost after Peter had preached the first great Christian sermon, \"Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?\" This \"What shall we do?\" is the deep heart cry of every man who suddenly realizes that he is a usurper and sits on a stolen throne. However painful, it is precisely this acute moral consternation that produces true repentance and makes a robust Christian after the penitent has been dethroned and has found forgiveness and peace through the gospel.\r\n<p>\"Purity of heart is to will one thing,\" said Kierkegaard, and we may with equal truth turn this about and declare, \"the essence of sin is to will one thing,\" for to set our will against the will of god is to dethrone God and make ourselves supreme in the little kingdom of Mansoul. This is sin at its evil root. Sins may multiply like the sands by the seashore, but they are yet one. Sins are because sin is. This is the rationale behind the much-maligned doctrine of natural depravity, which holds that the impenitent man can do nothing but sin and that his good deeds are really not good at all. His best religious works God rejects as He rejected the offering of Cain. Only when he has restored his stolen throne to God are his works acceptable.','Acts 2:37','When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\"','Impenitent man can do nothing but sin, and his good deeds are not good at all.

Eight hundred years before the advent of Christ the prophet Isaiah identified sin as rebellion against the will of God and the assertion of the right of each man to choose for himself the way he shall go. \"All we like sheep have gone astray,\" he said, \"we have turned everyone to his own way,\" and I believe that no more accurate description of sin has ever been given.\r\n<p>The witness of the saints has been in full harmony with prophet and apostle, that an inward principle of self lies at the source of human conduct, turning everything men do into evil. To save us completely, Christ must reverse the bent of our nature; He must plant a new principle within us so that our subsequent conduct will spring out of a desire to promote the honor of God and the good of our fellow men. The old self-sins must die, and the only instrument by which they can be slain is the cross. \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me,\" said our Lord, and years later the victorious Paul could say, \"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My God, shall sin its power maintain<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in my soul defiant live!<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Tis not enough that Thou forgive,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cross must rise and self be slain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O God of love, Thy power disclose:<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Tis not enough that Christ should rise,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, must seek the brightening skies,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rise from death, as Christ arose.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek Hymn','Matthew 16:24','\"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\"','No more accurate description of sin has been given that the words found in Isaiah 53:6: \"We all, like sheep, have gone astray, / each of us has turned to his own way.\"','Father, give us the strength to deny our selfish desires and to turn to You for our salvation.'),(1332,'The Knowledge of the Holy','6','The Self-sufficiency of God',NULL,'God Is in Himself','Teach us, O God, that nothing is necessary to Thee.

The <i>necessary</i> is wholly foreign to God.\r\n<p>Since He is the Being supreme over all, it follows that God cannot be elevated. Nothing is above Him, nothing beyond Him. Any motion in His direction is elevation for the creature; away from Him, descent. He holds His position out of Himself and by leave of none. As no one can promote Him, so no one can degrade Him.

But the truth is that God is not greater for our being, nor would He be less if we did not exist. That we do exist is altogether of God\'s free determination, not by our desert nor by divine necessity.\r\n<p>Probably the hardest thought of all for our natural egotism to entertain is that God does not need our help. We commonly represent Him as a busy, eager, somewhat frustrated Father hurrying about seeking help to carry out His benevolent plan to bring peace and salvation to the world; but, as said the Lady Julian, \"I saw truly that God doeth all-thing, be it never so little.\" The God who worketh all things surely needs no help and no helpers.\r\n<p>Too many missionary appeals are based upon this fancied frustration of Almighty God.

To communicate with us in an idiom we can understand, God in the Scriptures makes full use of military terms; but surely it was never intended that we should think of the throne of the Majesty on high as being under siege, with Michael and his hosts or some other heavenly beings defending it from stormy overthrow. So to think is to misunderstand everything the Bible would tell us about God. Neither Judaism nor Christianity could approve such puerile notions. A God who must be defended is one who can help us only while someone is helping Him. We may count upon Him only if He wins in the cosmic seesaw battle between right and wrong. Such a God could not command the respect of intelligent men; He could only excite their pity.\r\n<p>To be right we must think worthily of God. It is morally imperative that we purge from our minds all ignoble concepts of the Deity and let Him be the God in our minds that He is in His universe. The Christian religion has to do with God and man, but its focal point is God, not man. Man’s only claim to importance is that he was created in the divine image; in himself he is nothing. The psalmists and prophets of the Scriptures refer in sad scorn to weak man whose breath is in his nostrils, who grows up like the grass in the morning only to be cut down and wither before the setting of the sun. That God exists for Himself and man for the glory of God is the emphatic teaching of the Bible. The high honor of God is first in heaven as it must yet be in earth.','Isaiah 40:6','\"All men are like grass, / and all their glory is like the flowers of the field.\"','A god who must be defended is one who can assist men only if someone else is helping him. Such a god could only excite our pity.','God, help us to grasp the notion that You do not need defending.

Among all created beings, not one dare trust in itself. God alone trusts in Himself; all other beings must trust in Him. Unbelief is actually perverted faith, for it puts its trust not in the living God but in dying men. The unbeliever denies the self-sufficiency of God and usurps attributes that are not his. This dual sin dishonors god and ultimately destroys the soul of man.\r\n<p>In His love and pity God came to us as Christ. This has been the consistent position of the Church from the days of the apostles. It is fixed for Christian belief in the doctrine of the incarnation of the Eternal Son. In recent times, however, this has come to mean something different from, and less than, what it meant to the early church. The Man Jesus as he appeared in the flesh has been equated with the Godhead and all His human weaknesses and limitations attributed to the Deity. The truth is that the Man who walked among us was a demonstration, not of unveiled deity but of perfect humanity. The awful majesty of the Godhead was mercifully sheathed in the soft envelope of human nature to protect mankind. \"Go down,\" God told Moses on the mountain, \"charge the people, lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish\"; and later, \"Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.\"','Exodus 33:20','\"You cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.\"','Christ, who walked among us, was a demonstration of perfect humanity.

They try to achieve communion with Him by divesting Him of His burning holiness and unapproachable majesty, the very attributes He veiled while on earth but assumed in fullness of glory upon His ascension to the Father\'s right hand. The Christ of popular Christianity has a weak smile and a halo. He has become Someone-up-There who likes people, at least some people, and these are grateful but not too impressed. If they need Him, He also needs them.\r\n<p>Let us not imagine that the truth of the divine self-sufficiency will paralyze Christian activity. Rather it will stimulate all holy endeavor. This truth, while a needed rebuke to human self-confidence, will when viewed in its biblical perspective lift from our minds the exhausting load of morality and encourage us to take the easy yoke of Christ and spend ourselves in Spirit-inspired toil for the honor of God and the good of mankind. For the blessed news is that the God who needs no one has in sovereign condescension stooped to work by and in and through His obedient children.','Matthew 11:29','\"Take my  yoke upon  you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

Were we to reject the concept, it would be altogether impossible for us to think again the thoughts of prophets and apostles, so full were they of the long dreams of eternity.\r\n<p>Because the word everlasting is sometimes used by the sacred writers to mean no more than long-lasting (as \"the everlasting hills\"), some persons have argued that the concept of unending existence was not in the minds of the writers when they used the word but was supplied later by the theologians. This is of course a serious error, and, as far as I can see, has no ground in serious scholarship. It has been used by certain teachers as an escape from the doctrine of eternal punishment. These reject the eternity of moral retribution, and to be consistent they are forced to weaken the whole idea of endlessness. This is not the only instance where an attempt was made to slay a truth to keep it quiet lest it appear as a material witness against an error.','Nehemiah 9:5','\"Stand up and praise the Lord your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting.\"','The concept of everlastingness runs throughout the Bible and is persistent in Christian thought.','Father, help us to grasp this concept and to shun the idea that it means no more than long-lasting.'),(1341,'The Knowledge of the Holy','7','The Eternity of God',NULL,'Absolute Everlastingness','The truth is that if the Bible did not teach that God possessed endless being in the ultimate meaning of that term, we would be compelled to infer it from His other attributes, and if the Holy Scriptures had no word for absolute everlastingness, it would be necessary for us to coin one to express the concept, for it is assumed, implied, and generally taken for granted everywhere throughout the inspired Scriptures. The idea of endlessness is to the kingdom of God what carbon is to the kingdom of nature. As carbon is present almost everywhere, as it is an essential element in all living matter and supplies all life with energy, so the concept of everlastingness is necessary to give meaning to any Christian doctrine. Indeed I know of no tenet of the Christian creed that could retain its significance if the idea of eternity were extracted from it.\r\n<p>\"From everlasting to everlasting, thou art God,\" said Moses in the Spirit. \"From the vanishing point to the vanishing point\" would be another way to say it quite in keeping with the words as Moses used them. The mind looks backward in time till the dim past vanishes, then turns and looks into the future till thought and imagination collapse from exhaustion; and God is at both points, unaffected by either.\r\n<p>Time marks the beginning of created existence, and because God never began to exist it can have not application to Him. \"Began\" is a time-word, and cannot have personal meaning for the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No age can heap its outward years on Thee;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear God!

When time-words occur in the Scriptures, they refer to our time, not to His. When the four living creatures before the throne cry day and night, \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come,\" they are identifying God with the flow of creature-life with its familiar three tenses; and this right and good, for God has sovereignly willed so to identify Himself. But because God is uncreated, He is not Himself affected by that succession of consecutive changes we call time.\r\n<p>God dwells in eternity but time dwells in God. He has already lived all our tomorrows as He has lived all our yesterdays. An illustration offered by C.S. Lewis may help us here. He suggests that we think of a sheet of paper infinitely extended. That would be eternity. Then on that paper draw a short line to represent time. As the line begins and ends on that infinite expanse, so time began in God and will end in Him.\r\n<p>That God appears at time\'s beginning is not too difficult to comprehend, but that He appears at the beginning and end of time <i>simultaneously</i> is not so easy to grasp; yet it is true. Time is known to us by a succession of events. It is the way we account for consecutive changes in the universe. Changes take place not all at once but in succession, one after the other, and it is the relation of \"after\" to \"before\" that gives us our idea of time. We wait for the sun to move from east to west or for the hour hand to move around the face of the clock, but God is not compelled so to wait. For Him everything that will happen already has happened.','Revelation 4:8','Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings.

Thus, because Thou are God almighty, Thou dwellest within the wall of Paradise, and this wall is that coincidence where later is one with earlier, where the end is one with the beginning, where Alpha and Omega are the same. . . .

But, O my God, the Absolute and Eternal, it is beyond the present and the past that Thou dost exist and utter speech.\"\r\n<p>When he was a very old man, Moses wrote the psalm from which I have quoted earlier in this chapter. In it he celebrates the eternity of God. To him this truth is a solid theological fact as firm and hard as that Mount Sinai with which he was so familiar, and for him it had two practical meanings: because God is eternal, He can be and continue forever to be the one safe home for His time-driven children. \"Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.\" The second thought is less comforting: God\'s eternity is so long and our years on earth are so few, how shall we establish the work of our hands? How shall we escape the abrasive action of events that would wear us out and destroy us? God fills and dominates that psalm, so it is to Him that Moses makes his plaintive appeal, \"So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.\" May the knowledge of Thy eternity not be wasted on me!','Psalm 90:1&#150;2','Lord, you have been our dwelling place / throughout all generations. Before the mountains were born / or you brought forth the earth and the world, / from everlasting to everlasting you are God.','Because You are eternal Father, You can be the one safe home for us who are bound by time and subject to its wreck and ruin.','Teach us, Lord, to number our days so that we can apply ourselves to Your wisdom.'),(1344,'The Knowledge of the Holy','7','The Eternity of God',NULL,'Made of the Stuff of Eternity','We who live in this nervous age would be wise to meditate on our lives and our days long and often before the face of God and on the edge of eternity.

To be made for eternity and forced to dwell in time is for mankind a tragedy of huge proportions. All within us cries for life and permanence, and everything around us reminds us of mortality and change. Yet that God has made us of the stuff of eternity is both a glory and a prophecy, a glory yet to be realized and a prophecy yet to be fulfilled.\r\n<p>I hope it will not be found unduly repetitious if I return again to that important pillar of Christian theology, the image of God in man. The marks of the divine image have been so obscured by sin that they are not easy to identify, but is it not reasonable to believe that one mark may be man’s insatiable craving for immortality?','Ecclesiastes 3:11','He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.','One mark of how man is made in the image of God is his insatiable craving for immortality.','We would be wise, Father, to consider our lives in light of eternity.

So is he ground between the upper millstone of hope and the nether stone of fear.\r\n<p>Just here the sweet relevancy of the Christian message appears. \"Jesus Christ . . .

There can be no second.','Psalm 147:5','Great is our Lord and mighty in power; / his understanding has no limit.','Used precisely, the word infinitude can belong to One&#151;the Lord!','God, You are greater than all language.

Of course no wealth is unlimited and no energy boundless unless we are speaking of the wealth and energy of God.\r\n<p>Again, to say that God is infinite is to say that He is measureless. Measurement is the way created things have of accounting for themselves. It describes limitations, imperfections, and cannot apply to God. Weight describes the gravitational pull of the earth upon material bodies; distance describes intervals between bodies in space; length means extension in space, and there are other familiar measurements such as those for liquid, energy, sound, light, and numbers for pluralities.

And this is life eternal: to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent.\r\n<p>The mercy of God is infinite, too, and the man who has felt the grinding pain of inward guilt knows that this is more than academic. \"Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.\" Abounding sin is the terror of the world, but abounding grace is the hope of mankind. However sin may abound it still has its limits, for it is the product of finite minds and hearts; but God\'s \"much more\" introduces us to infinitude. Against our deep creature-sickness stands God\'s infinite ability to cure.\r\n<p>The Christian witness through the centuries has been that \"God so loved the world . . .\"; it remains for us to see that love in the light of God\'s infinitude. His love is measureless. It is more: it is boundless. It has no bounds because it is not a thing but a facet of the essential nature of God. His love is something He is, and because He is infinite that love can enfold the whole created world in itself and have room for ten thousand times ten thousand worlds beside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, this is the God we adore,<br>\r\n&nbsp;Our faithful, unchangeable Friend,<br>\r\nWhose love is as great as His power,<br>\r\n&nbsp;And neither knows measure nor end.<br>\r\nTis Jesus, the first and the last,<br>\r\n&nbsp;Whose Spirit shall guide us safe home;<br>\r\nWe\'ll praise Him for all that is past,<br>\r\n&nbsp;And trust Him for all that\'s to come.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&#151;Joseph Hart','Romans 5:20','But where sin increased, grace increased all the more.','Abounding sin is the terror of the world, but abounding grace is the hope of mankind.','Thank You, Father, for loving us so much that You sent Your only Son so that we might have eternal life.

We rest in Thee without fear or doubt and face our tomorrows without anxiety. Amen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immutability of God is among those attributes less difficult to understand, but to grasp it we must discipline ourselves to sort out the usual thoughts with which we think of created things from the rarer ones that arise when we try to lay hold of whatever may be comprehended of God.   \r\n<p>To say that God is immutable is to say that He never differs from Himself. The concept of a growing or developing God is not found in the Scriptures. It seems to me impossible to think of God as varying from Himself in any way. Here is why:\r\n<p>For a moral being to change it would be necessary that the change be in one of three directions. He must go from better to worse or from worse to better; or, granted that the moral quality remain stable, he must change within himself, as from immature to mature or from one order of being to another. It should be clear that God can move in none of these directions. His perfections forever rule out any such possibility.','Numbers 23:19','God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act?','God\'s perfections rule out the possibility of change.','God, You are our dwelling place in times of change. We turn to You for safety, for stability, like a rock in a fierce storm, an anchor for our lost souls!'),(1354,'The Knowledge of the Holy','9','The Immutability of God',NULL,'Perfectly Holy','God cannot change for the better. Since He is perfectly holy, He has never been less holy than He is now and can never be holier than He is and has always been. Neither can God change for the worse. Any deterioration within the unspeakably holy nature of God is impossible. Indeed I believe it impossible even to think of such a thing, for the moment we attempt to do so, the object about which we are thinking is no longer God but something else and someone less than He. The one of whom we are thinking may be a great and awesome creature, but because he is a creature he cannot be the self-existent Creator.\r\n<p>As there can be no mutation in the moral character of God, so there can be none within the divine essence. The being of God is unique in the only proper meaning of that word; that is, His being is other than and different from all other beings. We have seen how God differs from His creatures in being self-existent, self-sufficient, and eternal. By virtue of these attributes God is God and not some other being. One who can suffer any slightest degree of change is neither self-existent, self-sufficient, nor eternal, and so is not God.\r\n<p>Only a being composed of parts may change, for change is basically a shift in  the relation of the parts of a whole or the admission of some foreign element into the original composition. Since God is self-existent, He is not composed. There are in Him no parts to be altered. And since He is self-sufficient, nothing can enter His being from without.\r\n<p>”Whatever is composed of parts,” says Anselm, “is not altogether one, but is in some sort plural, and diverse from itself; and either in fact or  in concept is capable of dissolution. But these things are alien to Thee, than whom nothing better can be conceived of. Hence, there are no parts in Thee, Lord, nor art Thou more than one. But Thou art so truly a unitary being, and so identical with Thyself, that in no respect art Thou unlike Thyself; rather Thou art unity itself, indivisible by any conception.','Malachi 3:6','\"I the Lord do not change.\"','Change is basically a shift in the relation of the parts of a whole or the admission of some foreign element. But is self-existent and not composed. There are in Him no parts that can be altered. Because he is self-sufficient, nothing outside of Him can enter His being.','Holy, holy, holy, You are, Father. Help us to grasp that concept.'),(1355,'The Knowledge of the Holy','9','The Immutability of God',NULL,'No Change Is Possible with God','\"All that God is He has always been, and all that He has been and is He will ever be.\" Nothing that God has ever said about Himself will be modified; nothing the inspired prophets and apostles have said about Him will be rescinded. His immutability guarantees this.\r\n<p>The immutability of God appears in its most perfect beauty when viewed against the mutability of men. In God no change is possible; in men change is impossible to escape. Neither the man is fixed nor his world, but be and it are in constant flux. Each man appears for a little while to laugh and weep, to work and play, and then to go to make room for those who shall follow him in the never-ending cycle.\r\n<p>Certain poets have found a morbid pleasure in the law of impermanence and have sung in a minor key the song of perpetual change. Omar the tentmaker was one who sang with pathos and humor of mutation and mortality, the twin diseases that afflict mankind. \"Don\'t slap that clay around so roughly,\" he exhorts the potter, \"that may be your grandfather\'s dust you make so free with.\" \"When you lift the cup to drink red wine,\" he reminds the reveler, \"you may be kissing the lips of some beauty dead long ago.\"\r\n<p>This note of sweet sorrow expressed with gentle humor gives a radiant beauty to his quatrains but, however beautiful, the whole long poem is sick, sick unto death. Like the bird charmed by the serpent that would devour it, the poet is fascinated by the enemy that is destroying him and all men and every generation of men.','2 Corinthians 4:7','But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.','We are fragile and prone to change, always in constant flux. In us, change is impossible to escape.','Your immutability, Father, guarantees our salvation.

They have found the cure for the great sickness. God, they say, changes not. The law of mutation belongs to a fallen world, but God is immutable, and in Him men of faith find at last eternal permanence. In the meanwhile change works for the children of the kingdom, not against them. The changes that occur in them are wrought by the hand of the in-living Spirit. \"But we all,\" says the apostle, \"with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.\"\r\n<p>In a world of change and decay not even the man of faith can be completely happy.

Faber<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words of Faber find sympathetic response in every heart; yet much as we may deplore the lack of stability in all earthly things, in a fallen world such as this the very ability to change is a golden treasure, a gift from God of such fabulous worth as to call for constant thanksgiving. For human beings the whole possibility of redemption lies in their ability to change. To move across from one sort of person to another is the essence of repentance: the liar becomes truthful, the thief honest, the lewd pure, the proud humble. The whole moral texture of the life is altered. The thoughts, the desires, the affections are transformed, and the man is no longer what he had been before. So radical is this change that the apostle calls the man that used to be \"the old man\" and the man that now is \"the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.\"','2 Corinthians 3:18','And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord\'s glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.','Our ability for change is a golden treasure, a gift from God of fabulous worth.

The old man, even at his best, possesses only the life of Adam: the new man has the life of God. And this is more than a mere manner of speaking; it is quite literally true. When God infuses eternal life into the spirit of a man, the man becomes a member of a new and higher order of being.\r\n<p>In the working out of His redemptive processes, the unchanging God makes full use of change and through a succession of changes arrives at permanence at last. In the Book of Hebrews this is shown most clearly. \"He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second,\" is a kind of summation of the teaching of that remarkable book. The old covenant, as something provisional, was abolished, and the new and everlasting covenant took its place. The blood of goats and bulls lost its significance when the blood of the Paschal Lamb was shed. The law, the altar, the priesthood&#151;all were temporary and subject to change; now the eternal law of God is engraven forever on the living, sensitive stuff of which the human soul is composed. The ancient sanctuary is no more, but the new sanctuary is eternal in the heavens and there the Son of God has His eternal priesthood.\r\n<p>Here we see that God uses change as a lowly servant to bless His redeemed household, but He Himself is outside of the law of mutation and is unaffected by any changes that occur in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all things as they change proclaim<br>\r\nThe Lord eternally the same.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#151;Charles Wesley<br>','Hebrews 10:9','Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second.','The old covenant has been abolished, and the new and everlasting covenant has taken its place.

But while such men may be in the majority, they do not by any means compose the whole of the population. There are still the 7,000 who have not bowed their knees to Baal. These believe they were created to worship God and to enjoy His presence forever, and they are eager to learn all they can about the God with whom they expect to spend eternity.\r\n<p>In this world where men forget us, change their attitude toward us as their private interests dictate, and revise their opinion of us for the slightest cause, is it not a source of wondrous strength to know that the God with whom we have to do changes not?

He cannot be persuaded to alter His Word nor talked into answering selfish prayer. In all our efforts to find God, to please Him, to commune with Him, we should remember that all change must be on our part. \"I am the Lord, I change not.\" We have but to meet His clearly stated terms, bring our lives into accord with His revealed will, and His infinite power will become instantly operative toward us in the manner set forth through the gospel in the Scriptures of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFountain of being!

But it is more: it is to say that God has never learned and cannot learn.\r\n<p>The Scriptures teach that God has never learned from anyone. \"Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?\" \"For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor?\" These rhetorical questions put by the prophet Isaiah and the apostle Paul declare that God has never learned.\r\n<p>From there it is only a step to the conclusion that God cannot learn. Could God at any time or in any manner receive into His mind knowledge that He did not possess and had not possessed from eternity, He would be imperfect and less than Himself. To think of a God who must sit at the feet of a teacher, even though that teacher be an archangel or a seraph, is to think of someone other than the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth.','Isaiah 40:13','Who has understood the mind of the Lord, / or instructed him as his counselor?','If God could at any time receive into His mind knowledge that He did not possess, He would be imperfect and less than Himself.','Lord, You know all things.

So far in this examination of the attributes of God we have been driven to the free use of negatives. We have seen that God had no origin, that He had no beginning, that He requires no helpers, that He suffers no change, and that in His essential being there are no limitations.\r\n<p>This method of trying to make men see what God is like by showing them what He is not like is used also by the inspired writers in the Holy Scriptures. \"Hast thou not known? Hast thou not heard,\" cries Isaiah, \"that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?\" And that abrupt statement by God Himself, \"I am the Lord, I change not,\" tells us more about the divine omniscience than could be told in a 10,000-word treatise, were all negatives arbitrarily ruled out. God\'s eternal truthfulness is stated negatively by the apostle Paul, \"God . . . Cannot lie\"; and when the angel asserted that \"with God nothing shall be impossible,\" the two negatives add up to a ringing positive.','Isaiah 40:28','Do you not know? / Have you not heard? / The Lord is everlasting God, / the Creator of the ends of the earth. / He will not grow tired or weary, / and his understanding no one can fathom.','When we try to think of what God is like, it may be best to think of what He is not like.','Our feeble minds can know little of what You are like, Father.

Is it not enough that He is God?\r\n<p>When Christian theology declares that God is wise, it means vastly more than it says or can say, for it tries to make a comparatively weak word bear an incomprehensible plenitude of meaning that threatens to tear it apart and crush it under the sheer weight of the idea. \"His understanding is infinite,\" says the psalmist.

For this reason the apostle is accurate when he refers to God as \"only wise.\" That is, God is wise in Himself, and all the shining wisdom of men or angels is but a reflection of that uncreated effulgence that streams from the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.','Daniel 2:21','He changes times and seasons; / he sets up kings and deposes them. / He gives wisdom to the wise / and knowledge to the discerning.','Our wisdom, whatever it might be, is pathetically small compared to the boundless wisdom of God.','Lord, help us to understand a bit of who You are and help us not to question Your wisdom or power.'),(1366,'The Knowledge of the Holy','11','The Wisdom of God',NULL,'The Root of All Truth','The idea of God as infinitely wise is at the root of all truth.

To refuse to do this is to betray the very thing in us that distinguishes us from the beasts.\r\n<p>In the Holy Scriptures, wisdom, when used of God and good men, always carries a strong moral connotation. It is conceived as being pure, loving, and good. Wisdom that is mere shrewdness is often attributed to evil men, but such wisdom is treacherous and false. These two kinds of wisdom are in perpetual conflict. Indeed, when seen from the lofty peak of Sinai or Calvary, the whole history of the world is discovered to be but a contest between the wisdom of God and the cunning of Satan and fallen men. The outcome of the contest is not in doubt. The imperfect must fall before the perfect at last. God has warned that He will take the wise in their own craftiness and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.\r\n<p>Wisdom, among other things, is the ability to devise perfect ends and to achieve those ends by the most perfect means.

They do not attempt to supply \"sufficient reasons\"; they assert that the \"creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.\" No effort here to justify the ways of God with men; just a simple declaration of fact. The being of God is its own defense.','Romans 8:20&#150;21','For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.','Our “best of all possible worlds” lies under the shadow of a huge calamity&#151;the fall of man.','Lord, help us to celebrate Your being, Your wisdom.'),(1368,'The Knowledge of the Holy','11','The Wisdom of God',NULL,'We Base Our Hope in God Alone','But there is hope in all our tears.

In the meantime we rest our hope in the only wise God, our Savior, and wait with patience the slow development of His benign purposes.\r\n<p>In spite of tears and pain and death we believe that the God who made us all is infinitely wise and good. As Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, and was fully persuaded that what He had promised He was able to perform, so do we base our hope in God alone and hope against hope till the day breaks. We rest in what God is. I believe that this alone is true faith. Any faith that must be supported by the evidence of the senses is not real faith. \"Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\"\r\n<p>The testimony of faith is that, no matter how things look in this fallen world, all God\'s acts are wrought in perfect wisdom. The incarnation of the Eternal Son in human flesh was one of God\'s mighty deeds, and we may be sure that this awesome deed was done with a perfection possible only to the Infinite. \"Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.\"','John 20:27','Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\"','We base our hope in God alone and hope against hope until the day of Christ’s return.

Amen.\r\n<p>In the time of his vision John the Revelator heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings sounding throughout the universe, and what the voice proclaimed was the sovereignty and omnipotence of God: \"Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.\"\r\n<p>Sovereignty and omnipotence must go together. One cannot exist without the other. To reign, God must have power, and to reign sovereignly, He must have all power. And that is what omnipotent means, having all power. The word derives from the Latin and is identical in meaning with the more familiar almighty which we have from the Anglo-Saxon. This latter word occurs 56 times in our English Bible and is never used of anyone but God. He alone is almighty.\r\n<p>God possesses what no creature can: an incomprehensible plenitude of power, a potency that is absolute. This we know by divine revelation, but once known, it is recognized as being in full accord with reason. Grant that God is infinite and self-existent and we see at once that He must be all-powerful as well, and reason kneels to worship before the divine omnipotence.\r\n<p>\"Power belongeth unto God,\" says the psalmist, and Paul the apostle declares that nature itself gives evidence of the eternal power of the Godhead (Romans 1:20). From this knowledge we reason to the omnipotence of God this way&#151;God has power. Since God is also infinite, whatever He has must be without limit; therefore God has limitless power, He is omnipotent. We see further that God the self-existent Creator is the source of all the power there is, and since a source must be at least equal to anything that emanates from it, God is of necessity equal to all the power there is, and this is to say again that He is omnipotent.','Genesis 17:1','\"I am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.\"','God possesses what no creature can&#151;an incomprehensible plenitude of power, potency that is absolute.','Praise God!

Forever He must remain what He has forever been, the Lord God omnipotent.\r\n<p>One cannot long read the Scriptures sympathetically without noticing the radical disparity between the outlook of men of the Bible and that of modern men. We are today suffering from a secularized mentality. Where the sacred writers saw God, we see the laws of nature. Their world was fully populated; ours is all but empty. Their world was alive and personal; ours is impersonal and dead. God ruled their world; ours is ruled by the laws of nature, and we are always once removed from the presence of God.\r\n<p>And what are these laws of nature that have displaced God in the minds of millions? Law has two meanings. One is an external rule enforced by authority, such as the common rule against robbery and assault. The word is also used to denote the uniform way things act in the universe, but this second use of the word is erroneous. What we see in nature is simply the paths God\'s power and wisdom take through creation. Properly these are phenomena, not laws, but we call them laws by analogy with the arbitrary laws of society.','Romans 1:20','For since the creation of the world God\'s invisible qualities&#151;his eternal power and divine nature&#151;have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.','What we see in nature is simply the paths God\'s power and wisdom take through creation.

The trustworthiness of God\'s behavior in His world is the foundation of all scientific truth. Upon it the scientist rests his faith and from there he goes on to achieve great and useful things in such fields as those of navigation, chemistry, agriculture, and the medical.\r\n<p>Religion, on the other hand, goes back of nature to God. It is concerned not with the footprints of God along the paths of creation, but with the One who treads those paths. Religion is interested primarily in the One who is the source of all things, the master of every phenomenon. For this One philosophy has various names, the most horrendous that I have seen being that supplied by Rudolf Otto: \"The absolute, the gigantic, never-resting, active world stress.\" The Christian delights to remember that this \"world stress\" once said \"I AM,\" and that the greatest teacher of them all directed His disciples to address Him as a person: \"When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\" The men of the Bible everywhere communed with this \"gigantic absolute\" in language as personal as speech affords, and with Him prophet and saint walked in a rapture of devotion, warm, intimate, and deeply satisfying.','Exodus 3:14','God said to Moses, \"I AM WHO I AM.

He sought a place of retirement and after a season alone with God arose to his feet completely cured, and went forth in fullness of joy to found what has since become one of the largest foreign missionary societies in the world.

This means that His being knows no limits. Therefore there can be no limit to His presence; He is omnipresent. In His infinitude He surrounds the finite creation and contains it.

Is it a material world running by itself, or is it spiritual and run by unseen powers? Does this interlocking system explain itself or does its secret lie in mystery? Does the stream of existence begin and end in itself? Or is its source higher up and farther back in the hills?\r\n<p>Christian theology claims to have the answer to these questions. It does not speculate nor offer an opinion but presents its \"Thus saith the Lord\" as its authority. It declares positively that the world is spiritual: it originated in spirit, flows out of spirit, is spiritual in its essence, and is meaningless apart from the Spirit that inhabits it.\r\n<p>The doctrine of the divine omnipresence personalizes man\'s relation to the universe in which he finds himself.

At this point faith begins, and while it may go on to include a thousand other wonderful truths, these all refer back to the truth that God is, and God is here. \"He that cometh to God,\" says the Book of Hebrews, \"must believe that he is.\" And Christ Himself said, \"Ye believe in God, believe also . . .\" Whatever \"also\" may be added to the elementary belief in God is superstructure, and regardless of the heights to which it may rise, it continues to rest solidly upon the original foundation.','Hebrews 11:6','And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.','God is present, near us, next to us, and this God sees us and knows us through and through.','Help us, Lord, to believe in You, to sense Your presence, to live in Your presence.'),(1383,'The Knowledge of the Holy','14','God\'s Omnipresence',NULL,'God Is Indeed There','The teaching of the New Testament is that God created the world by the Logos, the Word, and the Word is identified with the second Person of the Godhead who was present in the world even before He became incarnate in human nature. The Word made all things and remained in His creation to uphold and sustain it and be at the same time a moral light enabling every man to distinguish good from evil. The universe operates as an orderly system, not by impersonal laws but by the creative voice of the immanent and universal Presence, the Logos.\r\n<p>Canon W. G. H. Holmes of India told of seeing Hindu worshipers tapping on trees and stones and whispering \"Are you there? Are you there?\" to the god they hoped might reside within. In complete humility the instructed Christian brings the answer to that question. God is indeed there. He is there as He is here and everywhere, not confined to tree or stone, but free in the universe, near to everything, next to everyone, and through Jesus Christ immediately accessible to every loving heart. The doctrine of the divine omnipresence decides this forever.\r\n<p>This truth is to the convinced Christian a source of deep comfort in sorrow and of steadfast assurance in all the varied experiences of his life. To him \"the practice of the presence of God\" consists not of projecting an imaginary object from within his own mind and then seeking to realize its presence; it is rather to recognize the real presence of the One whom all sound theology declares to be already there, an objective entity, existing apart from any apprehension of Him on the part of His creatures. The resultant experience is not visionary but real.','John 1:1&#150;2','In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning.','God is there as He is here and everywhere, not confined to tree or stone. He is free in the universe, near to everything, next to everyone, and through Jesus immediately accessible to every loving heart.','Lord, thank You for the promise of Your Word that You are with us always and everywhere.'),(1384,'The Knowledge of the Holy','14','God\'s Omnipresence',NULL,'All Will Be Well','The certainty that God is always near us, present in all parts of His world, closer to us than our thoughts, should maintain us in a state of high moral happiness most of the time. But not all the time. It would be less than honest to promise every believer continual jubilee and less than realistic to expect it. As a child may cry out in pain even when sheltered in its mother\'s arms, so a Christian may sometimes know what it is to suffer even in the conscious presence of God. Though always rejoicing,\" Paul admitted that he was sometimes sorrowful, and for our sakes Christ experienced strong crying and tears though He never left the bosom of the Father (John 1:18).\r\n<p>But all will be well. In a world like this tears have their therapeutic effects. The healing balm distilled from the garments of the enfolding Presence cures our ills before they become fatal. The knowledge that we are never alone calms the troubled sea of our lives and speaks peace to our souls.\r\n<p>That God is here both Scripture and reason declare. It remains only for us to learn to realize this in conscious experience. A sentence from a letter by Dr. Allen Fleece sums up the testimony of many others: \"The knowledge that God is present is blessed, but to feel His presence is nothing less than sheer happiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod reveals His presence:<br>\r\nLet us now adore Him,<br>\r\nAnd with awe appear before Him.\r\n<br>\r\nHim alone, God we own;<br>\r\nHe\'s our Lord and Saviour,<br>\r\nPraise His name forever.\r\n<br>\r\nGod Himself is with us:<br>\r\nWhom the angelic legions<br>\r\nServe with awe in beavenly regions.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerhard Tersteegen','John 1:18','No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father’s side, has made him known.','The healing balm distilled from the garments of the enfolding Presence cures our ills before they become fatal.

Amen.\r\n<p>As emphasized earlier, God\'s attributes are not isolated traits of His character but facets of His unitary being. They are not things in themselves; they are, rather, thoughts by which we think of God, aspects of a perfect whole, names given to whatever we know to be true of the Godhead.\r\n<p>To have a correct understanding of the attributes it is necessary that we see them all as one. We can think of them separately but they cannot be separated. \"All attributes assigned to God cannot differ in reality, by reason of the perfect simplicity of God, although we in divers ways use of God divers words,\" says Nicholas of Cusa. \"Whence, although we attribute to God sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch, sense, reason, and intellect, and so forth, according to the divers significations of each word, yet in Him sight is not other than hearing, or tasting, or smelling, or touching, or feeling, or understanding. And so all theology is said to be established in a circle because any one of His attributes is affirmed of another.\"','Psalm 36:5','Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens, / your faithfulness to the skies.','God\'s attributes are not things in themselves. They are thoughts by which we think of God, aspects of a perfect whole, names given to whatever we know to be true of the Godhead.','Give us wisdom to think rightly of You, to consider Your attributes as one, intrinsic of who You are.'),(1386,'The Knowledge of the Holy','15','The Faithfulness of God',NULL,'The Absolutely Perfect Godhead','In studying any attribute, the essential oneness of all the attributes soon becomes apparent. We see, for instance, that if God is self-existent He must be also self-sufficient; and if He has power He, being infinite, must have all power. If He possesses knowledge, His infinitude assures us that He possesses all knowledge. Similarly, His immutability presupposes His faithfulness. If He is unchanging, it follows that He could not be unfaithful since that would require Him to change. Any failure within the divine character would argue imperfection and because God is perfect, it could not occur. Thus, the attributes explain each other and prove that they are but glimpses the mind enjoys of the absolutely perfect Godhead.\r\n<p>All of God\'s acts are consistent with all of His attributes. No attribute contradicts any other, but all harmonize and blend into each other in the infinite abyss of the Godhead. All that God does agrees with all that God is, and being and doing are one in Him. The familiar picture of God as often torn between His justice and His mercy is altogether false to the facts. To think of God as inclining first toward one and then toward another of His attributes is to imagine a God who is unsure of Himself, frustrated and emotionally unstable, which of course is to say that the one of whom we are thinking is not the true God at all but a weak, mental reflection of Him badly out of focus.','2 Samuel 22:31','\"As for God, his way is perfect; / the word of the Lord is flawless.\"','None of God\'s attributes contradicts any other, but all of them harmonize and blend into each other in the infinite abyss of the Godhead.','Lord, thank You that Your way is perfect and that Your word is flawless.'),(1387,'The Knowledge of the Holy','15','The Faithfulness of God',NULL,'Faithful and Immutable','God, being who He is, cannot cease to be what He is, and being what He is, He cannot act out of character with Himself. He is at once faithful and immutable, so all His words and acts must be and must remain faithful. Men become unfaithful out of desire, fear, weakness, loss of interest, or because of some strong influence from without. Obviously none of these forces can affect God in any way. He is His own reason for all He is and does. He cannot be compelled from without, but ever speaks and acts from within Himself by His own sovereign will as it pleases Him.\r\n<p>I think it might be demonstrated that almost every heresy that has afflicted the church through the years has arisen from believing about God things that are not true, or from over emphasizing certain true things so as to obscure other things equally true. To magnify any attribute to the exclusion of another is to head straight for one of the dismal swamps of theology; and yet we are all constantly tempted to do just that.\r\n<p>For instance, the Bible teaches that God is love; some have interpreted this in such a way as virtually to deny that He is just, which the Bible also teaches. Others press the biblical doctrine of God\'s goodness so far that it is made to contradict His holiness. Or they make His compassion cancel out His truth. Still others understand the sovereignty of God in a way that destroys or at least greatly diminishes His goodness and love.\r\n<p>We can hold a correct view of truth only by daring to believe everything God has said about Himself. It is a grave responsibility that a man takes upon himself when he seeks to edit out of God\'s self-revelation such features as he in his ignorance deems objectionable. Blindness in part must surely fall upon any of us presumptuous enough to attempt such a thing. And it is wholly uncalled for. We need not fear to let the truth stand as it is written. There is no conflict among the divine attributes. God\'s being is unitary. He cannot divide Himself and act at a given time from one of His attributes while the rest remain inactive. All that God is must accord with all that God does. Justice must be present in mercy, and love in judgment. And so with all the divine attributes.','Psalm 85:10','Love and faithfulness meet together; / righteousness and peace kiss each other.','Almost every heresy that has afflicted the church through the years has arisen from believing about God things that are not true, or from over emphasizing certain true things so as to obscure other things equally true.','Holy Father, give us the will, help us to dare to believe everything that You have said about Yourself.'),(1388,'The Knowledge of the Holy','15','The Faithfulness of God',NULL,'Life Motivation','The faithfulness of God is a datum of sound theology, but to the believer it becomes far more than that: it passes through the processes of the understanding and goes on to become nourishing food for the soul. For the Scriptures not only teach truth, they show also its uses for mankind. The inspired writers were men of like passion with us, dwelling in the midst of life. What they learned about God became to them a sword, a shield, a hammer; it became their life motivation, their good hope, and their confident expectation. From the objective facts of theology, their hearts made how many thousand joyous deductions and personal applications! The Books of Psalms rings with glad thanksgiving for the faithfulness of God. The New Testament takes up the theme and celebrates the loyalty of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; and in the Apocalypse, Christ is seen astride a white horse riding toward His triumph, and the names He bears are Faithful and True.\r\n<p>Christian song, too, celebrates the attributes of God, and among them the divine faithfulness. In our hymnody, at its best, the attributes become the wellspring from which flow rivers of joyous melody. Some old hymnbooks may yet be found in which the hymns have no names; a line in italics above each one indicates its theme, and the worshiping heart cannot but rejoice in what it finds: \"God\'s glorious perfections celebrated.\" \"Wisdom, majesty and goodness.\" \"Omniscience.\" \"Omnipotence and immutability.\" \"Glory, mercy and grace.\" These are a few samples taken from a hymnbook published in 1849, but everyone familiar with Christian hymnody knows that the stream of sacred song takes its rise far back in the early years of the Church\'s existence. From the beginning belief in the perfection of God brought sweet assurance to believing men and taught the ages to sing.','Revelation 19:11','I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True.','The faithfulness of God is a datum of sound theology, but to the believer it becomes far more than that: it passes through the processes of the understanding and goes on to become nourishing food for the soul.','Nourish our soul, Lord, with the truth of Your faithfulness.'),(1389,'The Knowledge of the Holy','15','The Faithfulness of God',NULL,'True to His Pledged Word','Upon God\'s faithfulness rests our whole hope of future blessedness.

The tempted, the anxious, the fearful, the discouraged may all find new hope and good cheer in the knowledge that our Heavenly Father is faithful. He will ever be true to His pledged word.

The meaning may be arrived at only by the use of a number of synonyms, going out from and returning by different paths to the same place.\r\n<p>When Christian theology says that God is good, it is not the same as saying that He is righteous or holy. The holiness of God is trumpeted from the heavens and re-echoed on earth by saints and sages wherever God has revealed Himself to men; however, we are not at this time considering His holiness but His goodness, which is quite another thing.\r\n<p>The goodness of God is that which disposes Him to be kind, cordial, benevolent, and full of good will toward men. He is tenderhearted and of quick sympathy, and His unfailing attitude toward all moral beings is open, frank, and friendly. By His nature He is inclined to bestow blessedness and He takes holy pleasure in the happiness of His people.','Psalm 34:8','Taste and see that the Lord is good; / blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.','The goodness of God is that which disposes Him to be kind, cordial, benevolent, and full of good will toward men.','Thank You, Father, for Your unfailing goodness toward us.'),(1391,'The Knowledge of the Holy','16','The Goodness of God',NULL,'A Foundation Stone','That God is good is taught or implied on every page of the Bible and must be received as an article of faith as impregnable as the throne of God. It is a foundation stone for all sound thought about God and is necessary to moral sanity. To allow that God could be other than good is to deny the validity of all thought and end in the negation of every moral judgment. If God is not good, then there can be no distinction between kindness and cruelty, and heaven can be hell and hell, heaven.\r\n<p>The goodness of God is the drive behind all the blessings He daily bestows upon us. God created us because He felt good in His heart, and He redeemed us for the same reason.\r\n<p>Julian of Norwich, who lived 600 years ago, saw clearly that the ground of all blessedness is the goodness of God. Chapter six of her incredibly beautiful and perceptive little classic, Revelations of Divine Love, begins, \"This showing was made to learn our souls to cleave wisely to the goodness of God.\" Then she lists some of the mighty deeds God has wrought in our behalf, and after each one she adds \"of His goodness.\" She saw that all our religious activities and every means of grace, however right and useful they may be, are nothing until we understand that the unmerited, spontaneous goodness of God is back of all and underneath all His acts.','Psalm 86:5','You are forgiving and good, O Lord, / abounding in love to all who call to you.','If God is not good, then there can be no distinction between kindness and cruelty, and heaven can be hell and hell, heaven.','Your goodness is beneath all Your acts.

Because God is immutable He never varies in the intensity of His loving-kindness. He has never been kinder than He now is, nor will He ever be less kind. He is no respecter of persons but makes His sun to shine on the evil as well as on the good, and sends His rain on the just and on the unjust. The cause of His goodness is in Himself; the recipients of His goodness are all His beneficiaries without merit and without recompense.\r\n<p>With this agrees reason, and the moral wisdom that knows itself runs to acknowledge that there can be no merit in human conduct, not even in the purest and the best. Always God\'s goodness is the ground of our expectation. Repentance, though necessary, is not meritorious but a condition for receiving the gracious gift of pardon that God gives of His goodness. Prayer is not in itself meritorious. It lays God under no obligation nor puts Him in debt to any. He bears prayer because He is good, and for no other reason. Nor is faith meritorious; it is simply confidence in the goodness of God, and the lack of it is a reflection upon God\'s holy character.','Psalm 119:68','You are good, and what you do is good; / teach me your decrees.','God is no respecter of persons, but He makes sun to shine on the evil as well as on the good.

Years of rebellion against God have bred in us a fear that cannot be overcome in a day. The captured rebel does not enter willingly the presence of the king he has so long fought unsuccessfully to overthrow. But if he is truly penitent he may come, trusting only in the loving-kindness of his Lord, and the past will not be held against him. Meister Eckhart encourages us to remember that, when we return to God, even if our sins were as great in number as all mankind\'s put together, still God would not count them against us, but would have as much confidence in us as if we had never sinned.','Psalm 136:1','Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. / His love endures forever.','When we return to God, even if our sins were as great in number as all mankind’s put together, still God will not count them against us.','Forgive our sins, Holy Father, and do not count them against us.'),(1394,'The Knowledge of the Holy','16','The Goodness of God',NULL,'Exactly Like Jesus','Now someone who in spite of his past sins honestly wants to become reconciled to God may cautiously inquire, \"If I come to God, how will He act toward me?

This was only one of the things He did while here in the flesh, but this He did with beautiful perfection.\r\n<p>From Him we learn how God acts toward people. The hypocritical, the basically insincere, will find Him cold and aloof, as they once found Jesus; but the penitent will find Him merciful; the self-condemned will find Him generous and kind.

Holy men of tender compassion, outraged by the inequity of the world\'s rulers, prayed, \"O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?\" And this is to be understood not as a plea for personal vengeance but as a longing to see moral equity prevail in human society.','Genesis 18:25','\"Far be it from  you to do such a thing&#151;to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike.

This is an error of thinking as well as of speaking, for it postulates a principle of justice outside of God that compels Him to act in a certain way. Of course there is no such principle. If there were it would be superior to God, for only a superior power can compel obedience. The truth is that there is not and can never be anything outside of the nature of God that can move Him in the least degree. All God\'s reasons come from within His uncreated being. Nothing has entered the being of God from eternity, nothing has been removed, and nothing has been changed.\r\n<p>Justice, when used of God, is a name we give to the way God is, nothing more; and when God acts justly, He is not doing so to conform to an independent criterion, but simply acting like Himself in a given situation. As gold is an element in itself and can never change nor compromise but is gold wherever it is found, so God is God, always, only, fully God, and can never be other than He is. Everything in the universe is good to the degree it conforms to the nature of God and evil as it fails to do so. God is His own self-existent principle of moral equity, and when He sentences evil men or rewards the righteous, He simply acts like Himself from within, uninfluenced by anything that is not Himself.','Psalm 119:126&#150;127','It is time for  you to act, O Lord; / your law is being broken. / Because I love your commands / more than gold, more than pure gold.','Justice, when used of God, is a name we give to the way God is, nothing more; and when God acts justly, He is not doing so to conform to an independent criterion, but simply acting like Himself in a given situation.','Father God, we bow before You in awe of how You act toward sinful men.'),(1399,'The Knowledge of the Holy','17','The Justice of God',NULL,'God\'s Being Is Unitary','All this seems, but only seems, to destroy the hope of justification for the returning sinner. The Christian philosopher and saint, Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, sought a solution to the the apparent contradiction between the justice and the mercy of God, \"How dost Thou spare the wicked,\" he inquired of God, \"if Thou are all just and supremely just?\" Then he looked straight at God for the answer, for he knew that it lies in <i>what God is</i>. Anselm\'s findings may be paraphrased this way: God\'s being is unitary; it is not composed of a number of parts working harmoniously, but simply one. There is nothing in His justice that forbids the exercise of His mercy. To think of God as we sometimes think of a court where a kindly judge, compelled by law, sentences a man to death with tears and apologies, is to think in a manner wholly unworthy of the true God. God is never at cross-purpose with Himself. No attribute of God is in conflict with another.\r\n<p>God\'s compassion flows out of His goodness, and goodness without justice is not goodness. God spares us because He is good, but He could not be good if He were not just. When God punishes the wicked, Anselm concludes, it is just because it is consistent with their deserts; and when he spares the wicked it is just because it is compatible with His goodness; so God does what becomes Him as the supremely good God. This is reason seeking to understand, not that it may believe but because it already believes.\r\n<p>A simpler and more familiar solution for the problem of how God can be just and still justify the unjust is found in the Christian doctrine of redemption. It is that, through the work of Christ in atonement, justice is not violated but satisfied when God spares a sinner. Redemptive theology teaches that mercy does not become effective toward a man until justice has done its work. The just penalty for sin was exacted when Christ our Substitute died for us on the cross. However unpleasant this may sound to the ear of the natural man, it has ever been sweet to the ear of faith. Millions have been morally and spiritually transformed by this message, have lived lives of great moral power, and died at last peacefully trusting in it.','Ephesians 1:7','In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God\'s grace that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.','God\'s compassion flows out of His goodness, and goodness without justice is not goodness.

But when the penitent sinner casts himself upon Christ for salvation, the moral situation is reversed. Justice confronts the changed situation and pronounces the believing man just. Thus justice actually goes over to the side of God\'s trusting children. This is the meaning of those daring words of the apostle John: \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\"\r\n<p>But God\'s justice stands forever against the sinner in utter severity. The vague and tenuous hope that God is too kind to punish the ungodly has become a deadly opiate for the consciences of millions. It hushes their fears and allows them to practice all pleasant forms of iniquity while death draws every day nearer and the command to repent goes unregarded.

Actually there is in principle no difference between the Old Testament and the New. In the New Testament Scriptures there is a fuller development of redemptive truth, but one God speaks in both dispensations, and what He speaks agrees with what He is. Wherever and whenever God appears to men, He acts like Himself. Whether in the Garden of Eden or the Garden of Gethsemane, God is merciful as well as just.

It will never be more since it is in itself infinite; and it will never be less because the infinite cannot suffer diminution. Nothing that has occurred or will occur in heaven or earth or hell can change the tender mercies of our God. Forever His mercy stands, a boundless, overwhelming immensity of divine pity and compassion.\r\n<p>As judgment is God\'s justice confronting moral inequity, so mercy is the goodness of God confronting human suffering and guilt. Were there no guilt in the world, no pain and no tears, God would yet be infinitely merciful; but His mercy might well remain hidden in His heart, unknown to the created universe. No voice would be raised to celebrate the mercy of which none felt the need. It is human misery and sin that call forth the divine mercy.\r\n<p>\"Kyrie eleison! Christe eleison!\" the Church has pleaded through the centuries; but if I mistake not I hear in the voice of its pleading a note of sadness and despair. Its plaintive cry, so often repeated in that tone of resigned dejection, compels one to infer that it is praying for a boon it never actually expects to receive. It may go on dutifully to sing of the greatness of God and to recite the creed times beyond number, but its plea for mercy sounds like a forlorn hope and no more, as if mercy were a heavenly gift to be longed for but never really enjoyed.','Romans 9:15','For he says to Moses, \"I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, / and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.\"','As judgment is God\'s justice confronting moral inequity, so mercy is the goodness of God confronting human suffering and guilt.','How great You are, Father, and how great are Your mercies!'),(1404,'The Knowledge of the Holy','18','The Mercy of God',NULL,'God Is Merciful','Could our failure to capture the pure joy of mercy consciously experienced be the result of our unbelief or our ignorance, or both?

They have compelled this verse to stand by itself, unrelated to other Scriptures bearing on the doctrine of grace, and have made it teach that Moses knew only law and Christ knows only grace. So the Old Testament is made to be a book of law and the New Testament a book of grace. The truth is quite otherwise.\r\n<p>The law was given to men through Moses, but it did not originate with Moses. It had existed in the heart of God from before the foundation of the world. On Mount Sinai it became the legal code for the nation of Israel; but the moral principles it embodies are eternal. There never was a time when the law did not represent the will of God for mankind nor a time when the violation of it did not bring its own penalty, though God was patient and sometimes \"winked\" at wrongdoing because of the ignorance of the people. Paul\'s close-knit arguments in the third and fifth chapters of his epistle to the Romans make this very clear. The spring of Christian morality is the love of Christ, not the law of Moses; nevertheless there has been no abrogation of the principles of morality contained in the law. No privileged class exists exempt from that righteousness that the law enjoins.','Romans 3:22&#150;23','This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.

This fear persists while we are subject to the will of someone who does not desire our well-being. The moment we come under the protection of one of goodwill, fear is cast out. A child lost in a crowded store is full of fear because it sees the strangers around it as enemies. In its mother\'s arms a moment later all the terror subsides. The known good will of the mother casts out fear.','1 John 4:17','In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him.','We do not know, and we may never know, what love is, but we can know how it manifests itself, and that is enough for us here.','Through Your love, Father, drive out the fear from our lives.'),(1414,'The Knowledge of the Holy','20','The Love of God',NULL,'Love Disposes Him','The world is full of enemies, and as long as we are subject to the possibility of harm from these enemies, fear is inevitable.

The disciples might well have hesitated to claim friendship with Christ, but Christ said to them, \"Ye are my friends.\" Modesty may demur at so rash a thought, but audacious faith dares to believe the Word and claim friendship with God.

Acts of self-sacrifice are common to love. Christ said of Himself, \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"\r\n<p>It is a strange and beautiful eccentricity of the free God that He has allowed His heart to be emotionally identified with men. Self-sufficient as He is, He wants our love and will not be satisfied till He gets it.

God enjoys His creation. The Apostle John says frankly that God\'s purpose in creation was His own pleasure. God is happy in His love for all that He has made. We cannot miss the feeling of pleasure in God\'s delighted references to His handiwork. Psalm 104 is a divinely inspired nature poem almost rhapsodic in its happiness, and the delight of God is felt throughout it. \"The glory of the Lord shall endure forever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.\"\r\n<p>The Lord takes peculiar pleasure in His saints. Many think of God as far removed, gloomy and mightily displeased with everything, gazing down in a mood of fixed apathy upon a world in which He has long ago lost interest; but this is to think erroneously. True, God hates sin and can never look with pleasure upon iniquity, but where men seek to do God\'s will He responds in genuine affection. Christ in His atonement has removed the bar to the divine fellowship.

Earth is the place where the pleasures of love are mixed with pain, for sin is here, and hate and ill will. In such a world as ours love must sometimes suffer, as Christ suffered in giving Himself for His own.

It is active, creative, and benign. \"God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\" \"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.\" So it must be where love is; love must ever give to its own, whatever the cost. The apostles rebuked the young churches sharply because a few of their members had forgotten this and bad allowed their love to spend itself in personal enjoyment while their brethren were in need. \"But whoso hath this world\'s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?\" So wrote that John who has been known to the centuries as \"the Beloved.\"','Romans 5:8','But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.','Earth is the place where the pleasures of love are mixed with pain, for sin is here, and hate and ill will.','Help us, Lord, to never forget Your great love for us.'),(1420,'The Knowledge of the Holy','20','The Love of God',NULL,'Personal and Intimate','The love of God is one of the great realities of the universe, a pillar upon which the hope of the world rests.

This is an It, an awful Thing, and can never be intellectually conceived, only sensed and felt in the depths of the human spirit. It remains as a permanent religious instinct, a feeling for that unnamed, undiscoverable Presence that \"runs quicksilverlike through creation\'s veins\" and sometimes stuns the mind by confronting it with a supernatural, suprarational, manifestation of itself. The man thus confronted is brought down and overwhelmed and can only tremble and be silent.','Jeremiah 5:22','\"Should you not fear me?\" declares the Lord. / \"Should you not tremble in my presence?\"','The man confronted by the holiness of God can do nothing but tremble and be silent.','Lord, teach us to be silent before You, to stand in awe of Your holiness.'),(1425,'The Knowledge of the Holy','21','The Holiness of God',NULL,'Incomprehensible Holiness','This nonrational dread, this feeling for the uncreated Mystery in the world, is back of all religion.

Of course, the difference between the religion of an Isaiah or a Paul and that of the animist is that one has truth and the other has not; he has only the \"numinous\" instinct. He \"feels after\" an unknown God, but an Isaiah and a Paul have found the true God through His own self-disclosure in the inspired Scriptures.\r\n<p>The feeling for mystery, even for the Great Mystery, is basic in human nature and indispensable to religious faith, but it is not enough. Because of it men may whisper, \"That awful Thing,\" but they do not cry, \"Mine Holy One!\" In the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures God carries forward His self-revelation and gives it personality and moral content. This awful Presence is shown to be not a Thing but a moral Being with all the warm qualities of genuine personality. More than this, He is the absolute quintessence of moral excellence, infinitely perfect in righteousness, purity, rectitude, and incomprehensible holiness. And in all this He is uncreated, self-sufficient and beyond the power of human thought to conceive or human speech to utter.','Colossians 2:2','My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God.','The feeling for mystery, even for the Great Mystery, is basic in human nature and indispensable to religious faith, but it is not enough.','Help us to cry, Holy Father, \"Mine Holy One!\" Help us to desire Your presence and to bow in humility to Your holiness.'),(1426,'The Knowledge of the Holy','21','The Holiness of God',NULL,'World-Filling Mystery','Through the self-revelation of God in the Scriptures and the illumination of the Holy Spirit, the Christian gains everything and loses nothing.

Today his heart may leap up with the happy cry, \"Abba Father, my Lord and my God!\" Tomorrow he may kneel with delighted trembling to admire and adore the High and Lofty One that inhabiteth eternity.\r\n<p>Holy is the way God is. To be holy He does not conform to a standard. He is that standard. He is absolutely holy with an infinite, incomprehensible fullness of purity that is incapable of being other than it is. Because He is holy, all His attributes are holy; that is, whatever we think of as belonging to God must be thought of as holy.\r\n<p>God is holy and He has made holiness the moral condition necessary to the health of His universe. Sin\'s temporary presence in the world only accents this. Whatever is holy is healthy; evil is a moral sickness that must end ultimately in death. The formation of the language itself suggests this, the English word holy deriving from the Anglo-Saxon halig, hal, meaning \"well, whole.\"','Romans 8:15','For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship.

Every wrathful judgment in the history of the world has been a holy act of preservation. The holiness of God, the wrath of God, and the health of the creation are inseparably united. God\'s wrath is His utter intolerance of whatever degrades and destroys. He hates iniquity as a mother hates the polio that would take the life of her child.\r\n<p>God is holy with an absolute holiness that knows no degrees, and this He cannot impart to His creatures. But there is a relative and contingent holiness that He shares with angels and seraphim in heaven and with redeemed men on earth as their preparation for heaven. This holiness God can and does impart to His children. He shares it with them by imputation and by impartation, and because He has made it available to them through the blood of the Lamb, He requires it of them. To Israel first and later to His Church God spoke, saying, \"Be ye holy; for I am holy.\" He did not say \"Be ye as holy as I am holy,\" for that would be to demand of us absolute holiness, something that belongs to God alone. Before the uncreated fire of God\'s holiness angels veil their faces. Yea, the heavens are not clean, and the stars are not pure in His sight.

We are not psychologically conditioned to understand freedom except in its imperfect forms. Our concepts of it have been shaped in a world where no absolute freedom exists. Here each natural object is dependent upon many other objects, and that dependence limits its freedom.\r\n<p>Wordsworth at the beginning of his \"Prelude\" rejoiced that he had escaped the city where he had long been pent up and was \"now free, free as a bird to settle where I will.\" But to be free as a bird is not to be free at all. The naturalist knows that the supposedly free bird actually lives its entire life in a cage made of fears, hungers, and instincts; it is limited by weather conditions, varying air pressures, the local food supply, predatory beasts, and that strangest of all bonds, the irresistible compulsion to stay within the small plot of land and air assigned it by birdland comity. The freest bird is, along with every other created thing, held in constant check by a net of necessity. Only God is free.\r\n<p>God is said to be absolutely free because no one and no thing can hinder Him or compel Him or stop Him. He is able to do as He pleases always, everywhere, forever. To be thus free means also that He must possess universal authority. That He has unlimited power we know from the Scriptures and may deduce from certain other of His attributes. But what about His authority?','Job 9:4','His wisdom is profound, his power is vast, / Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?','God is said to be absolutely free because no one and no thing can hinder Him or compel Him or stop Him.

Where is the greater one to whom He must appeal? \"Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.\"\r\n<p>The sovereignty of God is a fact well established in the Scriptures and declared aloud by the logic of truth. But admittedly it raises certain problems that have not to this time been satisfactorily solved. These are mainly two.\r\n<p>The first is the presence in the creation of those things that God cannot approve, such as evil, pain, and death. If God is sovereign He could have prevented their coming into existence. Why did He not do so?\r\n<p>The Zend-Avesta, sacred book of Zoroastrianism, loftiest of the great non-Biblical religions, got around this difficulty neatly enough by postulating a theological dualism. There were two Gods, Ormazd and Ahriman, and these between them created the world. The good Onnazd made all good things and the evil Ahriman made the rest. It was quite simple. Ormazd had no sovereignty to worry about, and apparently did not mind sharing his prerogatives with another.','Isaiah 44:6','\"This is what the Lord says&#151; / Israel’s King and Redeemer, the Lord Almighty; / I am the first and I am the last; / apart from me there is no God.\"','The sovereignty of God is a fact well established in the Scriptures and declared aloud by the logic of truth.','Give us a bit of understanding to know why good and evil exist&#151;and the faith to believe that in Your Sovereignty.'),(1432,'The Knowledge of the Holy','22','The Sovereignty of God',NULL,'Only One God','For the Christian this explanation will not do, for it flatly contradicts the truth taught so emphatically throughout the whole Bible, that there is one God and that He alone created the heaven and the earth and all the things that are therein. God\'s attributes are such as to make impossible the existence of another God. The Christian admits that he does not have the final answer to the riddle of permitted evil. But he knows what that answer is not. And he knows that the Zend-Avesta does not have it either.\r\n<p>While a complete explanation of the origin of sin eludes us, there are a few things we do know. In His sovereign wisdom God has permitted evil to exist in carefully restricted areas of His creation, a kind of fugitive outlaw whose activities are temporary and limited in scope. In doing this God has acted according to His infinite wisdom and goodness. More than that no one knows at present; and more than that no one needs to know. The name of God is sufficient guarantee of the perfection of His works','1 Corinthians 13:9&#150;10','For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.','In His sovereign wisdom God has permitted evil to exist in carefully restricted areas of His creation, a kind of fugitive outlaw whose activities are temporary and limited in scope.','Lord, You have told all we need to know about good and evil.

If God rules His universe by His sovereign decrees, how is it possible for man to exercise free choice? And if he cannot exercise freedom of choice, how can he be held responsible for his conduct? Is he not a mere puppet whose actions are determined by a behind-the-scenes God who pulls the strings as it pleases Him?\r\n<p>The attempt to answer these questions has divided the Christian church neatly into two camps that have borne the names of two distinguished theologians, Jacobus Arminius and John Calvin. Most Christians are content to get into one camp or the other and deny either sovereignty to God or free will to man. It appears possible, however, to reconcile these two positions without doing violence to either, although the effort that follows may prove deficient to partisans of one camp or the other.\r\n<p>Here is my view: God sovereignly decreed that man should be free to exercise moral choice, and man from the beginning has fulfilled that decree by making his choice between good and evil. When he chooses to do evil, he does not thereby countervail the sovereign will of God but fulfills it, inasmuch as the eternal decree decided not which choice the man should make but that he should be free to make it. If in His absolute freedom God has willed to give man limited freedom, who is there to stay His hand or say, \"What doest thou?\" Man\'s will is free because God is sovereign. A God less than sovereign could not bestow moral freedom upon His creatures. He would be afraid to do so.','Psalm 71:5','For you have been my hope, / O Sovereign Lord, / my confidence since my youth.','If God rules His universe by His sovereign decrees, how is it possible for man to exercise free choice?','Sovereign Lord, let us not be caught up in the ideas of man.

So it is, I believe, with man\'s freedom and the sovereignty of God. The mighty liner of God\'s sovereign design keeps its steady course over the sea of history. God moves undisturbed and unhindered toward the fulfillment of those eternal purposes that He purposed in Christ Jesus before the world began. We do not know all that is included in those purposes, but enough has been disclosed to furnish us with a broad outline of things to come and to give us good hope and firm assurance of future well-being.','2 Samuel 7:28','O Sovereign Lord, you are God!

No one can dissuade Him from His purposes; nothing turn Him aside from His plans. Since He is omniscient, there can be no unforeseen circumstances, no accidents.

God has decreed that all who willingly commit themselves to His Son Jesus Christ in the obedience of faith shall receive eternal life and become sons of God. He has also decreed that all who love darkness and continue in rebellion against the high authority of heaven shall remain in a state of spiritual alienation and suffer eternal death at last.\r\n<p>Reducing the whole matter to individual terms, we arrive at some vital and highly personal conclusions.

Here there is no chance, no gamble. There is freedom to choose that side we shall be on but no freedom to negotiate the results of the choice once it is made. By the mercy of God we may repent a wrong choice and alter the consequences by making a new and right choice. Beyond that we cannot go.','James 1:25','But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it&#151;he will be blessed in what he does.','Certain things have been decreed by the free determination of God, and one of these is the law of choice and consequences.','By Your grace, Father, we have made the choice to follow You.

Christ stated it plainly: \"He that is not with me is against me,\" and \"No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\" The gospel message embodies three distinct elements: an announcement, a command, and a call. It announces the good news of redemption accomplished in mercy; it commands all men everywhere to repent and it calls all men to surrender to the terms of grace by believing on Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.\r\n<p>We must all choose whether we will obey the gospel or turn away in unbelief and reject its authority.

Yet we must not think of the Church as an anonymous body, a mystical religious abstraction. We Christians are the Church, and whatever we do is what the Church is doing. The matter, therefore, is for each of us a personal one. Any forward step in the Church must begin with the individual.\r\n<p>What can we plain Christians do to bring back the departed glory? Is there some secret we may learn? Is there a formula for personal revival we can apply to the present situation, to our own situation? The answer to these questions is yes.\r\n<p>Yet the answer may easily disappoint some persons, for it is anything but profound. I bring no esoteric cryptogram, no mystic code to be painfully deciphered. I appeal to no hidden law of the unconscious, no occult knowledge meant only for the few. The secret is an open one that the wayfaring man may read. It is simply the old and ever-new counsel: Acquaint thyself with God. To regain its lost power, the Church must see heaven opened and have a transforming vision of God.','Psalm 86:12','I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart; / I will glorify your name forever.','To regain its lost power, the Church must see heaven opened and have a transforming vision of God.','We long to know You better, Father.

The God we must learn to know is the Majesty in the heavens, God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, the only wise God our Savior. He it is that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, who stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in, who bringeth out His starry host by number and calleth them all by name through the greatness of His power, who seeth the works of man as vanity, who putteth no confidence in princes and asks no counsel of kings.\r\n<p>Knowledge of such a Being cannot be gained by study alone. It comes by a wisdom the natural man knows nothing of, neither can know, because it is spiritually discerned. To know God is at once the easiest and the most difficult thing in the world. It is easy because the knowledge is not won by hard mental toil, but is something freely given. As sunlight falls free on the open field, so the knowledge of the holy God is a free gift to men who are open to receive it. But this knowledge is difficult because there are conditions to be met and the obstinate nature of fallen man does not take kindly to them.','Job 37:22','Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; / God comes in awesome majesty.','To know God is at once the easiest and the most difficult thing in the world.','Oh, that we would know You, Lord, in all Your awesome glory!'),(1440,'The Knowledge of the Holy','23','The Open Secret',NULL,'A Holy God','Let me present a brief summary of these conditions as taught by the Bible and repeated through the centuries by the holiest, sweetest saints the world has ever known:\r\n<p>First, we must forsake our sins. The belief that a holy God cannot be known by men of confirmed evil lives is not new to the Christian religion. The Hebrew book, <i>The Wisdom of Solomon</i>, which antedates Christianity by many years, has the following passage: \"Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good heart, and in simplicity of heart seek him. For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and showeth himself unto such as do not distrust him. For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise. For unto a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject to sin. For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in.\" This same thought is found in various sayings throughout the inspired Scriptures, the best known probably being the words of Christ, \"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\"\r\n<p>Second, there must be an utter committal of the whole life to Christ in faith. This is what it means to \"believe in Christ.\" It involves a volitional and emotional attachment to Him accompanied by a firm purpose to obey Him in all things. This requires that we keep His commandments, carry our cross, and love God and our fellow men.','Matthew 5:8','Blessed are the pure in heart, / for they will see God.','To believe in Christ involves a volitional and emotional attachment to Him accompanied by a firm purpose to obey Him in all things.','Give us strength and purpose, O Father, to keep Your commandments, to carry our crosses, and to love You and our fellow men.'),(1441,'The Knowledge of the Holy','23','The Open Secret',NULL,'God Is a Person','Third, there must be a reckoning of ourselves to have died unto sin and to be alive unto God in Christ Jesus, followed by a throwing open of the entire personality to the inflow of the Holy Spirit. Then we must practice whatever self-discipline is required to walk in the Spirit, and trample under our feet the lusts of the flesh.\r\n<p>Fourth, we must boldly repudiate the cheap values of the fallen world and become completely detached in spirit from everything that unbelieving men set their hearts upon, allowing ourselves only the simplest enjoyments of nature which God has bestowed alike upon the just and the unjust.\r\n<p>Fifth, we must practice the art of long and loving meditation upon the majesty of God. This will take some effort, for the concept of majesty has all but disappeared from the human race. The focal point of man\'s interest is now himself. Humanism in its various forms has displaced theology as the key to the understanding of life. When the 19th century poet Swinburne wrote, \"Glory to Man in the highest! for man is the master of things,\" he gave to the modern world its new Te Deum. All this must be reversed by a deliberate act of the will and kept so by a patient effort of the mind.\r\n<p>God is a Person and can be known in increasing degrees of intimate acquaintance as we prepare our hearts for the wonder. It may be necessary for us to alter our former beliefs about God as the glory that gilds the Sacred Scriptures dawns over our interior lives. We may also need to break quietly and graciously with the lifeless textualism that prevails among the gospel churches, and to protest the frivolous character of much that passes for Christianity among us. By this we may for the time lose friends and gain a passing reputation for being holier-than-thou; but no man who permits the expectation of unpleasant consequences to influence him in a matter like this is fit for the Kingdom of God.','2 Timothy 2:11','Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, / we will also live with him.','God is a Person and can be known in increasing degrees of intimate acquaintance as we prepare our hearts for the wonder.','Show Yourself to us, Holy Father, that we may know you better.'),(1442,'The Knowledge of the Holy','23','The Open Secret',NULL,'A Glorified Man','Sixth, as the knowledge of God becomes more wonderful, greater service to our fellow men will become for us imperative. This blessed knowledge is not given to be enjoyed selfishly. The more perfectly we know God the more we will feel the desire to translate the new-found knowledge into deeds of mercy toward suffering humanity. The God who gave all to us will continue to give all through us as we come to know Him better.\r\n<p>Thus far we have considered the individual\'s personal relation to God, but like the ointment of a man\'s right hand, which by its fragrance \"betrayeth itself,\" any intensified knowledge of God will soon begin to affect those around us in the Christian community. And we must seek purposefully to share our increasing light with the fellow members of the household of God.\r\n<p>This we can best do by keeping the majesty of God in full focus in all our public services. Not only our private prayers should be filled with God, but our witnessing, our singing, our preaching, our writing should center around the Person of our holy, holy Lord and extol continually the greatness of His dignity and power. There is a glorified Man on the right hand of the Majesty in heaven faithfully representing us there. We are left for a season among men; let us faithfully represent Him here.','Hebrews 8:1','We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man.','Not only our private prayers should be filled with God, but our witnessing, our singing, our preaching, our writing should center around the Person of our holy, holy Lord and extol continually the greatness of His dignity and power.','Father, by Your grace and Your power, may we well represent You here on this earth. Amen!'),(1443,'The Divine Conquest','1','The Eternal Continuum',NULL,'Neglected Christian Truths','The unconditioned priority of God in His universe is a truth celebrated both in the Old Testament and in the New. The prophet Habakkuk sang it in ecstatic language, \"Art thou not from everlasting, 0 Lord, my God, mine Holy One?\" The apostle John set it forth in careful words deep with meaning, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.\"\r\n<p>This truth is so necessary to right thoughts about God and ourselves that it can hardly be too strongly emphasized. It is a truth known to everyone, a kind of common property of all religious persons, but for the very reason that it is so common it now has but little meaning for any of us. It has suffered the fate of which Coleridge writes, \"Truths, of all others the most awful and interesting, are too often considered as so true, that they lose all the power of truth, and lie bedridden in the dormitory of the soul, side by side with the most despised and exploded errors.\" The Divine Priority is one of those \"bed-ridden\" truths. I desire to do what I can to rescue it \"from the neglect caused by the very circumstance of its universal admission.\" Neglected Christian truths can be revitalized only when by prayer and long meditation we isolate them from the mass of hazy ideas with which our minds are filled and hold them steadily and determinedly in the focus of the mind\'s attention.','Habakkuk 1:12','\"O Lord, are you not from everlasting? / My God, my Holy One, we will not die.\"','Neglected Christian truths can be revitalized only when by prayer and long meditation we isolate them from the mass of hazy ideas with which our minds are filled and hold them steadily and determinedly in the focus of the mind\'s attention.','Help us, Father, to focus all our attention on the truths of Your Word.'),(1444,'The Divine Conquest','1','The Eternal Continuum',NULL,'The Great Antecedent','For all things God is the great Antecedent. Because He is, we are and everything else is. He is that \"dread, unbeginning One,\" self-caused, self-contained and self-sufficient. Faber saw this when he wrote his great hymn in celebration of God\'s eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThou hast no youth, great God,<br>\r\nAn Unbeginning End Thou art;<br>\r\nThy glory in itself abode,<br>\r\nAnd still abides in its own tranquil heart:<br>\r\nNo age can heap its outward years on Thee:<br>\r\nDear God! Thou art Thyself Thine own eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo not skip this as merely another poem. The difference between a great Christian life and any other kind lies in the quality of our religious concepts, and the ideas expressed in these six lines can be like rungs on Jacob\'s ladder, leading upward to a sounder and more satisfying idea of God.\r\n<p>We cannot think rightly of God until we begin to think of Him as always being there, and there first. Joshua had this to learn. He had been so long the servant of God\'s servant Moses, and had with such assurance received God\'s word at his mouth, that Moses and the God of Moses had become blended in his thinking, so blended that he could hardly separate the two thoughts; by association they always appeared together in his mind. Now Moses is dead, and lest the young Joshua be struck down with despair, God spoke to assure him, \"As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.\" Moses was dead, but the God of Moses still lived. Nothing had changed and nothing had been lost. Nothing of God dies when a man of God dies.\r\n<p>\"As I was&#151;so I will be.\" Only God could say this. Only the Eternal One could stand in the timeless I AM and say, \"I was\" and \"I will be.\"','Joshua 1:5','\"No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with; I will never leave you nor forsake you.\"','We cannot think rightly of God until we begin to think of Him as always being there, and there first.','Let us think rightly of You, Lord, by realizing that You have always been there and that You were there first.'),(1445,'The Divine Conquest','1','The Eternal Continuum',NULL,'Alpha and Omega','Here we acknowledge (and there is fear and wonder in the thought) the essential unity of God\'s nature, the timeless persistence of His changeless Being throughout eternity and time. Here we begin to see and feel the Eternal Continuum. Begin where we will, God is there first. He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, which was, and which is, and which is to come, the Almighty. If we grope back to the farthest limits of thought where imagination touches the pre-creation void, we shall find God there. In one unified present glance He comprehends all things from everlasting, and the flutter of a seraph\'s wing a thousand ages hence is seen by Him now without moving His eyes.\r\n<p>Once I should have considered such thoughts to be mere metaphysical bric-a-brac without practical meaning for anyone in a world such as this. Now I recognize them as sound and easy-to-grasp truths with unlimited potential for good. Failure to get a right viewpoint in the beginning of our Christian lives may result in weakness and sterility for the rest of our days. May not the inadequacy of much of our spiritual experience be traced back to our habit of skipping through the corridors of the Kingdom like children through the marketplace, chattering about everything, but pausing to learn the true value of nothing?','Revelation 1:8','\"I am the Alpha and the Omega,\" says the Lord God, \"who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.\"','Failure to get a right viewpoint in the beginning of our Christian lives may result in weakness and sterility for the rest of our days.','Let us not be like chattering children, Father God, but let us have the patience to pause and learn of You.'),(1446,'The Divine Conquest','1','The Eternal Continuum',NULL,'His Uncreated Being','In my creature impatience I am often caused to wish that there were some way to bring modern Christians into a deeper spiritual life painlessly by short easy lessons; but such wishes are vain. No short cut exists. God has not bowed to our nervous haste nor embraced the methods of our machine age. It is well that we accept the hard truth now: the man who would know God must give time to Him. He must count no time wasted that is spent in the cultivation of His acquaintance. He must give himself to meditation and prayer hours on end. So did the saints of old, the glorious company of the apostles, the goodly fellowship of the prophets and the believing members of the holy Church in all generations. And so must we if we would follow in their train.\r\n<p>We would think of God, then, as maintaining the unity of His uncreated Being throughout all His works and His years, as ever saying not only, \"I did,\" and \"I will do,\" but also \"I do\" and \"I am doing.\"\r\n<p>A robust faith requires that we grasp this truth firmly, yet we know how seldom such a thought enters our minds. We habitually stand in our now and look back by faith to see the past filled with God. We look forward and see Him inhabiting our future; but our now is uninhabited except for ourselves. Thus we are guilty of a kind of pro tem atheism that leaves us alone in the universe while, for the time, God is not. We talk of Him much and loudly, but we secretly think of Him as being absent, and we think of ourselves as inhabiting a parenthetic interval between the God who was and the God who will be. And we are lonely with an ancient and cosmic loneliness. We are each like a little child lost in a crowded market, who has strayed but a few feet from its mother, yet because she cannot be seen, the child is inconsolable. So we try by every method devised by religion to relieve our fears and heal our hidden sadness; but with all our efforts we remain unhappy still, with the settled despair of men alone in a vast and deserted universe.','Psalm 64:9','All mankind will fear; / they will proclaim the works of God / and ponder what he has done.','We try by every method devised by religion to relieve our fears and heal our hidden sadness; but with all our efforts we remain unhappy still, with the settled despair of men alone in a vast and deserted universe.','Father, come and inhabit our \"now.\"'),(1447,'The Divine Conquest','1','The Eternal Continuum',NULL,'A Full Flowing River','But for all our fears we are not alone. Our trouble is that we think of ourselves as being alone. Let us correct the error by thinking of ourselves as standing by the bank of a full flowing river; then let us think of that river as being none else but God Himself. We glance to our left and see the river coming full out of our past; we look to the right and see it flowing on into our future. But we see also that it is flowing through our present. And in our today it is the same as it was in our yesterday, not less than, nor different from, but the very same river, one unbroken continuum, undiminished, active and strong as it moves sovereignly on into our tomorrow.\r\n<p>Wherever faith has been original, wherever it has proved itself to be real, it has invariably had upon it a sense of the present God. The Holy Scriptures possess in marked degree this feeling of actual encounter with a real Person. The men and women of the Bible talked with God. They spoke to Him and heard Him speak in words they could understand. With Him they held person-to-person converse, and a sense of shining reality is upon their words and deeds.','Revelation 22:1','Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of the city.','The men and women of the Bible talked with God. They spoke to Him and heard Him speak in words they could understand.','We stand in the river of Your love, Kind Father. Wash over us, flow through our present lives.'),(1448,'The Divine Conquest','1','The Eternal Continuum',NULL,'Someone There','The world\'s own prophets, the unbelieving psychologists (those eyeless seekers who seek for a light that is not God\'s light) have been forced to recognize at the bottom of religious experience this sense of something there. But better far is the sense of Someone there. It was this that filled with abiding wonder the first members of the Church of Christ. The solemn delight that those early disciples knew sprang straight from the conviction that there was One in the midst of them. They knew that the Majesty in the heavens was confronting them on earth: they were in the very Presence of God. And the power of that conviction to arrest attention and hold it for a lifetime, to elevate, to transform, to fill with uncontrollable moral happiness, to send men singing to prison and to death, has been one of the wonders of history and a marvel of the world.\r\n<p>Our fathers have told us and our own hearts confirm how wonderful is this sense of Someone there. It makes religion invulnerable to critical attack. It secures the mind against collapse under the battering of the enemy. They who worship the God who is present may ignore the objections of unbelieving men. Their experience is self-verifying and needs neither defense nor proof. What they see and hear overwhelms their doubts and confirms their assurance beyond the power of argument to destroy.','Job 37:22','Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; / God comes in awesome majesty.','Those who worship the God who is present may ignore the objections of unbelieving men.','Confirm in our hearts, Wonderful Father, the sense that You are there, close by.'),(1449,'The Divine Conquest','1','The Eternal Continuum',NULL,'The Touch of God','Some who desire to be teachers of the Word, but who understand neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm, insist upon \"naked\" faith as the only way to know spiritual things. By this they mean a conviction of the trustworthiness of the Word of God (a conviction, it may be noted, which the devils share with them). But the man who has been taught even slightly by the Spirit of Truth will rebel at this perversion. His language will be, \"I have heard Him and observed Him. What have I to do any more with idols?\" For he cannot love a God who is no more than a deduction from a text. He will crave to know God with a vital awareness that goes beyond words, and to live in the intimacy of personal communion. \"To seek our divinity merely in books and writings is to seek the living among the dead; we do but in vain many times seek God in these, where His truth too often is not so much enshrined as entombed. He is best discerned by an intellectual touch of Him. We must see with our eyes, and hear with our ears, and our hands must handle of the word of life.\" Nothing can take the place of the touch of God in the soul and the sense of Someone there. Real faith, indeed, brings such realization, for real faith is never the operation of reason upon texts. Where true faith is, the knowledge of God will be given as a fact of consciousness altogether apart from the conclusions of logic.\r\n<p>Were a man to awaken in the pitch dark at midnight and hear someone moving about in his room, and know that the unseen presence was a loved member of his family who had every right to be there, his heart might be filled with a sense of quiet pleasure; but should he have reason to believe that an intruder had entered, perhaps to rob or to kill, he would lie in terror and stare at the darkness not knowing from which direction the expected blow might come. But the difference between experience and no experience would be that acute sense of someone there. Is it not true that for most of us who call ourselves Christians there is no real experience? We have substituted theological ideas for an arresting encounter; we are full of religious notions, but our great weakness is that for our hearts there is no one there.','Hosea 14:8','O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols?','The difference between experience and no experience would be that acute sense of someone there. Is it not true that for most of us who call ourselves Christians there is no real experience?','Father, may it not be said of us that we have no real experience of You. Make it so in our hearts!'),(1450,'The Divine Conquest','1','The Eternal Continuum',NULL,'The Real Presence','Whatever else it embraces, true Christian experience must always include a genuine encounter with God. Without this, religion is but a shadow, a reflection of reality, a cheap copy of an original once enjoyed by someone else of whom we have heard. It cannot but be a major tragedy in the life of any man to live in a church from childhood to old age and know nothing more real than some synthetic god compounded of theology and logic, but having no eyes to see, no cars to hear, and no heart to love.\r\n<p>The spiritual giants of old were men who at some time became acutely conscious of the real Presence of God and maintained that consciousness for the rest of their lives. The first encounter may have been one of terror, as when a \"horror of great darkness\" fell upon Abram, or as when Moses at the bush hid his face because he was afraid to look upon God. Usually this fear soon lost its content of terror and changed after a while to delightsome awe, to level off finally into a reverent sense of complete nearness to God. The essential point is, they experienced God. How otherwise can the saints and prophets be explained? How otherwise can we account for the amazing power for good they have exercised over countless generations? Is it not that they walked in conscious communion with the real Presence and addressed their prayers to God with the artless conviction that they were addressing Someone actually there?','Genesis 15:12','As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.','The spiritual giants of old were men who at some time became acutely conscious of the real Presence of God and maintained that consciousness for the rest of their lives.','are there, Father.

God did not create life and toss it from Him like some petulant artist disappointed with his work. All life is in Him and out of Him, flowing from Him and returning to Him again, a moving indivisible sea of which He is the Fountainhead. That eternal life that was with the Father is now the possession of believing men, and that life is not God\'s gift only, but His very Self.\r\n<p>Redemption is not a strange work that God for a moment turned aside to do; rather it is His same work performed in a new field, the field of human catastrophe. The regeneration of a believing soul is but a recapitulation of all His work done from the moment of creation. It is hard to miss the parallel between generation as described in the Old Testament and regeneration as described in the New. How, for instance, could the condition of a lost soul better be described than by the words, \"without form and void,\" with darkness \"upon the face of the deep\"? And how could the strong yearnings of God\'s heart over that lost soul be more perfectly expressed than by saying that \"the Spirit of God brooded upon the face of the waters\"? And from what source could light come to that sin-shrouded soul had God not said, \"Let there be light\"? At His word the light breaks and the lost man arises to drink of eternal life and follow the Light of the World. As order and fruitfulness came next to that ancient creation, so moral order and spiritual fruit follow next in human experience. And we know that God is the same and His years fail not. He will always act like Himself wherever He is found at work and whatever work He is doing.','Genesis 1:2','Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.','Redemption is not a strange work that God for a moment turned aside to do; rather it is His same work performed in a new field, the field of human catastrophe.','Thank You, Lord, that You will always act like Yourself, that You are the same forever and ever.'),(1452,'The Divine Conquest','1','The Eternal Continuum',NULL,'He Gives All of Himself','We need to seek deliverance from our vain and weakening wish to go back and recover the past.

By one single impulse of life He created all days and all times, so that the life of the first day and the life of the remotest future day are united in Him.

And all that He is and all that He has done is for us and for all who share the common salvation. With full consciousness of our own demerit we may yet take our place in the love of God, and the poorest and weakest of us may without offense claim for ourselves all the riches of the Godhead in mercy given.

And when He arose the third day it was for me; and when He poured out upon the disciples the promised Holy Spirit it was that He might continue in me the work He had been doing for me since the morning of the creation.','1 Corinthians 15:3','For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.','For me Christ died, and the redemptive benefits of that death are by the miracle of His present life perpetuated forever, as efficacious now as on the day He bowed His head and gave up the ghost.','We give thanks, Father, for the work You did on our behalf, for the death of Your Son and for the promised Holy Spirit!'),(1454,'The Divine Conquest','2','In Word, or in Power',NULL,'A New Creation','\"Because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction\" (Thessalonians 1:5).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation\" (2 Corinthians 5:17).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead\" (Revelation 3:1).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo one who is a student merely, these verses might be interesting, but to a serious man intent upon gaining eternal, life they might well prove more than a little disturbing. For they evidently teach that the message of the gospel may be received in either of two ways: in word only, without power, or in word with power. Yet it is the same message whether it comes in word or in power. And these verses teach also that when the message is received in power it effects a change so radical as to be called a new creation. But the message may be received without power, and apparently some have so received it, for they have a name to live, and are dead. All this is present in these texts.\r\n<p>By observing the ways of men at play I have been able to understand better the ways of men at prayer. Most men, indeed, play at religion as they play at games, religion itself being of all games the one most universally played. The various sports have their rules and their balls and their players; the game excites interest, gives pleasure and consumes time, and when it is over the competing teams laugh and leave the field. It is common to see a player leave one team and join another and a few days later play against his old mates with as great zest as he formerly displayed when playing for them. The whole thing is arbitrary. It consists in solving artificial problems and attacking difficulties that have been deliberately created for the sake of the game. It has no moral roots and is not supposed to have. No one is the better for his self-imposed toil. It is all but a pleasant activity that changes nothing and settles nothing at last.','Revelation 3:1','\"These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation for being alive, but you are dead.\"','Most men, indeed, play at religion as they play at games, religion itself being of all games the one most universally played.','Father, forgive us for playing at religion and for failing to take seriously Your Word.'),(1455,'The Divine Conquest','2','In Word, or in Power',NULL,'Religious Game','If the conditions we describe were confined to the ball park, we might pass it over without further thought, but what are we to say when this same spirit enters the sanctuary and decides the attitude of men toward God and religion? For the Church has also its fields and its rules and its equipment for playing the game of pious words. It has its devotees, both laymen and professionals, who support the game with their money and encourage it with their presence, but who are no different in life or character from many who take in religion no interest at all.\r\n<p>As an athlete uses a ball so do many of us use words: words spoken and words sung, words written and words uttered in prayer. We throw them swiftly across the field; we learn to handle them with dexterity and grace; we build reputations upon our word-skill and gain as our reward the applause of those who have enjoyed the game. But the emptiness of it is apparent from the fact that after the pleasant religious game, no one is basically any different from what he had been before. The bases of life remain unchanged, the same old principles govern, the same old Adam rules.','Romans 5:14','Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those how did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.','For the Church has also its fields and its rules and its equipment for playing the game of pious words.

Water may change from liquid to vapor, from vapor to snow and back to liquid again, and still be fundamentally the same. So powerless religion may put a man through many surface changes and leave him exactly what he was before. Right there is where the snare lies. The changes are in form only, they are not in kind. Behind the activities of the nonreligious man and the man who has received the gospel without power lie the very same motives. An unblessed ego lies at the bottom of both lives, the difference being that the religious man has learned better to disguise his vice. His sins are refined and less offensive than before he took up religion, but the man himself is not a better man in the sight of God. He may indeed be a worse one, for always God hates artificiality and pretense. Selfishness still throbs like an engine at the center of the man\'s life. True he may learn to \"redirect\" his selfish impulses, but his woe is that self still lives unrebuked and even unsuspected within his deep heart. He is a victim of religion without power.\r\n<p>The man who has received the Word without power has trimmed his hedge, but it is a thorn hedge still and can never bring forth the fruits of the new life. Men do not gather grapes of thorns nor figs of thistles. Yet such a man may be a leader in the Church, and his influence and his vote may go far to determine what religion shall be in his generation.','Micah 7:4','The best of them is like a brier, / the most upright worse than a thorn hedge.','The man who has received the Word without power has trimmed his hedge, but it is a thorn hedge still and can never bring forth the fruits of the new life.','Lord, give us religion based on Your power.

A new and different Spirit enters the personality and makes the believing man new in every department of his being. His interests shift from things external to things internal, from things on earth to things in heaven. He loses faith in the soundness of external values, he sees clearly the deceptiveness of outward appearances and his love for and confidence in the unseen and eternal world become stronger as his experience widens.\r\n<p>With the ideas here expressed most Christians will agree, but the gulf between theory and practice is so great as to be terrifying. For the gospel is too often preached and accepted without power, and the radical shift that the truth demands is never made. There may be, it is true, a change of some kind; an intellectual and emotional bargain may be struck with the truth, but whatever happens is not enough, not deep enough, not radical enough. The \"creature\" is changed, but he is not \"new.\" And right there is the tragedy of it. The gospel is concerned with a new life, with a birth upward onto a new level of being, and until it has effected such a re-birth, it has not done a saving work within the soul.','2 Corinthians 5:17','Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!','For the gospel is too often preached and accepted without power, and the radical shift that the truth demands is never made.','Lord, we long to made new in You, new creations in Christ Jesus.'),(1458,'The Divine Conquest','2','In Word, or in Power?',NULL,'Good News and Judgment','Wherever the Word comes without power its essential content is missed. For there is in divine truth an imperious note, there is about the gospel an urgency, a finality that will not be heard or felt except by the enabling of the Spirit. We must constantly keep in mind that the gospel is not good news only, but a judgment as well upon everyone that hears it. The message of the Cross is good news indeed for the penitent, but to those who \"obey not the gospel\" it carries an overtone of warning. The Spirit\'s ministry to the impenitent world is to tell of sin and righteousness and judgment. For sinners who want to cease being willful sinners and become obedient children of God, the gospel message is one of unqualified peace, but it is by its very nature also an arbiter of the future destinies of men.\r\n<p>This secondary aspect is almost wholly overlooked in our day. The gift element in the gospel is held to be its exclusive content, and the shift element is accordingly ignored. Theological assent is all that is required to make Christians. This assent is called faith, and is thought to be the only difference between the saved and the lost. Faith is thus conceived as a kind of religious magic, bringing to the Lord great delight, and possessing mysterious power to open the kingdom of heaven.','Jonah 3:8','But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.','The gift element in the gospel is held to be its exclusive content, and the shift element is accordingly ignored.','We don\'t desire religious magic, Gracious Father, but Your Self as our hope and salvation.'),(1459,'The Divine Conquest','2','In Word, or in Power',NULL,'A Savior from What?','I want to be fair to everyone and to find all the good I can in every man\'s religious beliefs, but the harmful effects of this faith-as-magic creed are greater than could be imagined by anyone who has not come face to face with them. Large assemblies today are being told fervently that the one essential qualification for heaven is to be an evil man, and the one sure bar to God\'s favor is to be a good one. The very word righteousness is spoken only in cold scorn, and the moral man is looked upon with pity. \"A Christian,\" say these teachers, \"is not morally better than a sinner, the only difference is that he has taken Jesus, and so he has a Savior.\" I trust it may not sound flippant to inquire, \"A savior from what?\" If not from sin and evil conduct and the old fallen life, then from what? And if the answer is, From the consequences of past sins and from judgment to come, still we are not satisfied. Is justification from past offenses all that distinguishes a Christian from a sinner? Can a man become a believer in Christ and be no better than he was before? Does the gospel offer no more than a skillful Advocate to get guilty sinners off free at the day of judgment?','Titus 3:4','But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.','Is justification from past offenses all that distinguishes a Christian from a sinner?

We need a Savior who can make a difference in our lives now!'),(1460,'The Divine Conquest','2','In Word, or in Power',NULL,'A Judicial Change of Status','I think the truth of the matter is not too deep nor too difficult to discover. Self-righteousness is an effective bar to God\'s favor because it throws the sinner back upon his own merits and shuts him out from the imputed righteousness of Christ. And to be a sinner confessed and consciously lost is necessary to the act of receiving salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. This we joyously admit and constantly assert, but here is the truth that has been overlooked in our day: A sinner cannot enter the kingdom of God. The Bible passages that declare this are too many and too familiar to need repeating here, but the skeptical might look at Galatians 5:19&#150;21 and Revelation 21:8. How then can any man be saved? The penitent sinner meets Christ and after that saving encounter he is a sinner no more. The power of the gospel changes him, shifts the basis of his life from self to Christ, faces him about in a new direction and makes him a new creation. The moral state of the penitent when he comes to Christ does not affect the result, for the work of Christ sweeps away both his good and his evil and turns him into another man. The returning sinner is not saved by some judicial transaction apart from a corresponding moral change. Salvation must include a judicial change of status, but what is overlooked by most teachers is that it also includes an actual change in the life of the individual. And by this we mean more than a surface change, we mean a transformation as deep as the roots of his human life. If it does not go that deep it does not go deep enough.','Romans 12:2','Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.','Salvation must include a judicial change of status, but what is overlooked by most teachers is that it also includes an actual change in the life of the individual.','Change us, Kind Father, through and through.

The churches (even the gospel churches) are worldly in spirit, morally anemic, on the defensive, imitating instead of initiating and in a wretched state generally because for two full generations they have been told that justification is no more than a \"not guilty\" verdict pronounced by the Heavenly Father upon a sinner who can present the magic coin faith with the wondrous \"open-sesame\" engraved upon it. If it is not stated as bluntly as that, at least the message is so presented as to create such an impression. The whole business is the result of hearing the Word preached without power and receiving it in the same way.\r\n<p>Now faith is indeed the open-sesame to eternal blessedness. Without faith it is impossible to please God, neither can any man be saved apart from faith in the risen Savior. But the true quality of faith is almost universally missed&#151;its moral quality. It is more than mere confidence in the veracity of a statement made in Holy Writ. It is a highly moral thing and of a spiritual essence. It invariably effects radical transformation in the life of the one who exercises it. It shifts the inward gaze from self to God. It introduces its possessor into the life of heaven upon earth.','Hebrews 11:6','And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.','The true quality of faith is almost universally missed&#151;its moral quality.

All who know their own hearts and the provisions of the gospel will join in the prayer of the man of God:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen He shall come with trumpet sound,<br>\r\nO, may I then in Him be found;<br>\r\nDressed in His righteousness alone,<br>\r\nFaultless to stand before the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a distressing thing that a truth so beautiful should have been so perverted. But perversion is the price we pay for failure to emphasize the moral content of truth; it is the curse that follows rational orthodoxy when it has quenched or rejected the Spirit of Truth.','John 15:26','\"When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he testify about me.\"','Perversion is the price we pay for failure to emphasize the moral content of truth; it is the curse that follows rational orthodoxy when it has quenched or rejected the Spirit of Truth.','Help us to never quench the work of Your Spirit in our hearts, Father God.'),(1463,'The Divine Conquest','2','In Word, or in Power',NULL,'Sin\'s Human Captives','In asserting that faith in the gospel effects a change of life-motive from self to God, I am but stating the sober facts. Every man with moral intelligence must be aware of the curse that afflicts him inwardly; he must be conscious of the thing we call ego, by the Bible called flesh or self, but by whatever name called a cruel master and a deadly foe. Pharaoh never ruled Israel as tyrannically as this hidden enemy rules the sons and daughters of men. The words of God to Moses concerning Israel in bondage may well describe us all: \"I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows.\" And when, as the Nicene Creed so tenderly states, our Lord Jesus Christ \"for us men, and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried, and the third day He arose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father,\" what was it all for? That He might pronounce us technically free and leave us in our bondage? Never. Did not God say to Moses, \"I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey . . . and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Let my people go\"? For sin\'s human captives, God never intends anything less than full deliverance. The Christian message rightly understood means this: The God who by the word of the gospel proclaims men free, by the power of the gospel actually makes them free. To accept less than this is to know the gospel in word only, without its power.','Exodus 3:8','So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land of milk and honey.','Every man with moral intelligence must be aware of the curse that afflicts him inwardly; he must be conscious of the thing we call ego, by the Bible called flesh or self, but by whatever name called a cruel master and a deadly foe.','Thank You, Kind Father, that the power of the gospel makes us free.'),(1464,'The Divine Conquest','2','In Word, or in Power',NULL,'The Great Taskmaster, Self','They to whom the Word comes in power know this deliverance, this inward migration of the soul from slavery to freedom, this release from moral bondage.

What but little taskmasters, servants of the great taskmaster, Self, who stand before him and do his will? To name them all would require a book in itself, but we would point out one as a type or sample of the rest. It is the desire for social approval. This is not bad in itself and might be perfectly innocent if we were living in a sinless world, but since the race of men has fallen off from God and joined itself to His foes, to be a friend of the world is to be a collaborator with evil and an enemy of God. Still the desire to please men is back of all social acts from the highest civilizations to the lowest levels upon which human life is found. No one can escape it. The outlaw who flouts the rules of society and the philosopher who rises in thought above its common ways may seem to have escaped from the snare, but they have in reality merely narrowed the circle of those they desire to please. The outlaw has his pals before whom he seeks to shine; the philosopher his little coterie of superior thinkers whose approval is necessary to his happiness. For both, the motive-root remains uncut. Each draws his peace from the thought that he enjoys the esteem of his fellows, though each will interpret the whole business in his own way.','Galatians 5:4','You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.','The desire to please men is back of all social acts from the highest civilizations to the lowest levels upon which human life is found.

David could say, \"Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee,\" but the sons of this world have not God, they have only each other, and they walk holding to each other and looking to one another for assurance like frightened children. But their hope will fail them, for they are like a group of men, none of whom has learned to fly a plane, who suddenly find themselves aloft without a pilot, each looking to the other to bring them safely down. Their desperate but mistaken trust cannot save them from the crash that must certainly follow.\r\n<p>With this desire to please men so deeply implanted within us how can we uproot it and shift our life-drive from pleasing men to pleasing God? Well, no one can do it alone, nor can he do it with the help of others, nor by education nor by training nor by any other method known under the sun. What is required is a reversal of nature (that it is a fallen nature does not make it any the less powerful) and this reversal must be a supernatural act. That act the Spirit performs through the power of the gospel when it is received in living faith. Then He displaces the old with the new. Then He invades the life as sunlight invades a landscape and drives out the told motives as light drives away darkness from the sky.','Psalm 73:25','Whom have I in heaven but you? / And earth has nothing I desire besides you.','What is required to please God is a reversal of nature (that it is a fallen nature does not make it any the less powerful) and this reversal must be a supernatural act.','We invite Your Spirit, Holy Father, to come dwell in us and change our fallen nature to one attuned to Your will.'),(1466,'The Divine Conquest','2','In Word, or in Power',NULL,'Only God Matters','The way it works in experience is something like this: The believing man is overwhelmed suddenly by a powerful feeling that only God matters; soon this works itself out into his mental life and conditions all his judgments and all his values.

Soon he learns to love above all else the assurance that he is well pleasing to the Father in heaven.\r\n<p>It is this complete switch in their pleasure-source that has made believing men invincible. So could saints and martyrs stand alone, deserted by every earthly friend, and die for Christ under the universal displeasure of mankind. When, to intimidate him, Athanasius\' judges warned him that the whole world was against him, he dared to reply, \"Then is Athanasius against the world!\" That cry has come down the years and today may remind us that the gospel has power to deliver men from the tyranny of social approval and make them free to do the will of God.\r\n<p>I have singled out this one enemy for consideration, but it is only one, and there are many others. They seem to stand by themselves and have existence apart from each other, but it is only seeming. Actually they are but branches of the same poison vine, growing from the same evil root, and they die together when the root dies. That root is self, and the Cross is its only effective destroyer.\r\n<p>The message of the gospel, then, is the message of a new creation in the midst of an old, the message of the invasion of our human nature by the eternal life of God and the displacing of the old by the new. The new life seizes upon the believing man\'s nature and sets about its benign conquest, a conquest that is not complete until the invading life has taken full possession and a new creation has emerged. And this is an act of God without human aid, for it is a moral miracle and a spiritual resurrection.','John 15:5','I am the vine; you are the branches.

That call leaves no place for refusal except at the risk of affront to majesty. And with Paul it was not otherwise. God\'s call was also His command.

Christ is thus made to stand again before men\'s judgment seat; He is made to wait upon the pleasure of the individual, and after long and humble waiting is either turned away or patronizingly admitted. By a complete misunderstanding of the noble and true doctrine of the freedom of the human will salvation is made to depend perilously upon the will of man instead of upon the will of God.','John 14:26','\"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.\"','There is another and worse evil that springs from this basic failure to grasp the radical difference between the natures of the two worlds.

So completely do we ignore Him that it is only by courtesy that we can be called Trinitarian. The Christian doctrine of the Trinity boldly declares the equality of the Three Persons and the right of the Holy Spirit to be worshiped and glorified. Anything less than this is something less than Trinitarianism.','John 14:26','\"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.\"','A doctrine has practical value only as far as it is prominent in our thoughts and makes a difference in our lives.','Holy Spirit, we worship and glorify You as part of the Godhead.'),(1491,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'The Blessed Third Person','Our neglect of the doctrine of the blessed Third Person has had and is having serious consequences. For doctrine is dynamite. It must have emphasis sufficiently sharp to detonate it before its power is released. Failing this it may lie quiescent in the back of our minds for the whole of our lives without effect. The doctrine of the Spirit is buried dynamite. Its power awaits discovery and use by the Church. The power of the Spirit will not be given to any mincing assent to pneumatological truth. The Holy Spirit cares not at all whether we write Him into our credenda in the back of our hymnals; He waits for our emphasis. When He gets into the thinking of the teachers, He will get into the expectation of the hearers. When the Holy Spirit ceases to be incidental and again becomes fundamental the power of the Spirit will be asserted once more among the people called Christians.','1 Corinthians 2:12','We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.','The Holy Spirit cares not at all whether we write Him into our credenda in the back of our hymnals; He waits for our emphasis.','Father, let Your Spirit reign in our hearts and lives in power!'),(1492,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'The Idea of the Spirit','The idea of the Spirit held by the average church member is so vague as to be nearly nonexistent. When he thinks of the matter at all he is likely to try to imagine a nebulous substance like a wisp of invisible smoke that is said to be present in churches and to hover over good people when they are dying. Frankly he does not believe in any such thing, but he wants to believe something, and not feeling up to the task of examining the whole truth in the light of Scripture he compromises by holding belief in the Spirit as far out from the center of his life as possible, letting it make no difference in anything that touches him practically. This describes a surprisingly large number of earnest persons who are sincerely trying to be Christians.\r\n<p>Now, how should we think of the Spirit? A full answer might well run to a dozen volumes. We can at best only point to the \"gracious Unction from above\" and hope that the reader\'s own desire may provide the necessary stimulus to urge him on to know the blessed Third Person for himself.','John 1:32','Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.\"','When the average Christian thinks of the matter at all he is likely to try to imagine a nebulous substance like a wisp of invisible smoke that is said to be present in churches and to hover over good people when they are dying.','We long to know the Holy Spirit ourselves, Lord God; make it so in our lives'),(1493,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'The Power of the Spirit','If I read aright the record of Christian experience through the years, those who most enjoyed the power of the Spirit have had the least to say about Him by way of attempted definition. The Bible saints who walked in the Spirit never tried to explain Him. In post-biblical times many who were filled and possessed by the Spirit were by the limitations of their literary gifts prevented from telling us much about Him. They had no gift for self-analysis, but lived from within in uncritical simplicity. To them the Spirit was One to be loved and fellowshipped the same as the Lord Jesus Himself. They would have been lost completely in any metaphysical discussion of the nature of the Spirit, but they had no trouble in claiming the power of the Spirit for holy living and fruitful service.','2 Samuel 23:2','The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me; / his word was on my tongue.','The Bible saints who walked in the Spirit never tried to explain Him.','Father, give us Your Spirit so that we may live holy lives in service to You.'),(1494,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'Knowledge by Acquaintance','This is as it should be. Personal experience must always be first in real life. The most important thing is that we experience reality by the shortest and most direct method. A child may eat nutritious food without knowing anything about chemistry or diatetics. A country boy may know the delights of pure love while never having heard of Sigmund Freud or Havelock Ellis. Knowledge by acquaintance is always better than mere knowledge by description, and the first does not presuppose the second nor require it.\r\n<p>In religion more than in any other field of human experience a sharp distinction must always be made between knowing about and knowing. The distinction is the same as between knowing about food and actually eating it. A man can die of starvation knowing all about bread, and a man can remain spiritually dead while knowing all the historic facts of Christianity. \"This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" We have but to introduce one extra word into this verse to see how vast is the difference between knowing about and knowing. \"This is life eternal, that they might know about thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" That one word makes all the difference between life and death, for it goes to the very root of the verse and changes its theology radically and vitally.','John 17:3','\"Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\"','Knowledge by acquaintance is always better than mere knowledge by description, and the first does not presuppose the second nor require it.','We don’t want to know <i>about</i> the Holy Spirit, Father, we want to experience Him in our lives.'),(1495,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'Knowing Him','For all this we would not underestimate the importance of mere knowing about. Its value lies in its ability to rouse us to desire to know in actual experience. Thus knowledge by description may lead on to knowledge by acquaintance. May lead on, I say, but does not necessarily do so. Thus we dare not conclude that because we learn about the Spirit we for that reason actually know Him. Knowing Him comes only by a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit Himself.\r\n<p>How shall we think of the Spirit? A great deal can be learned about the Holy Spirit from the word spirit itself. Spirit means existence on a level above and beyond matter; it means life subsisting in another mode. Spirit is substance that has no weight, no dimension, no size nor extension in space. These qualities belong to matter and can have no application to spirit. Yet spirit has true being and is objectively real. If this is hard to visualize, just pass it up, for it is at best but a clumsy attempt of the mind to grasp that which is above the mind\'s powers. And no harm is done if in our thinking about the Spirit we are forced by the limitations of our intellects to clothe Him in the familiar habiliments of material form.','Galatians 5:16','So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.','Spirit means existence on a level above and beyond matter; it means life subsisting in another mode. Spirit is substance that has no weight, no dimension, no size nor extension in space.','Holy Spirit, we long to know You, to have a personal encounter with You.'),(1496,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'A Person','How shall we think of the Spirit? The Bible and Christian theology agree to teach that He is a Person, endowed with every quality of personality, such as emotion, intellect and will. He knows, He wills, He loves; He feels affection, antipathy and compassion. He thinks, sees, hears and speaks and performs any act of which personality is capable.\r\n<p>One quality belonging to the Holy Spirit, of great interest and importance to every seeking heart, is penetrability. He can penetrate matter, such as the human body; He can penetrate mind; He can penetrate another spirit, such as the human spirit. He can achieve complete penetration of and actual intermingling with the human spirit. He can invade the human heart and make room for Himself without expelling anything essentially human. The integrity of the human personality remains unimpaired. Only moral evil is forced to withdraw.','Ephesians 3:16','I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being.','One quality belonging to the Holy Spirit, of great interest and importance to every seeking heart, is penetrability.','Invade our hearts, Holy Spirit; help us to make room for You in our innermost beings.'),(1497,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'Two Distinct Substances','The metaphysical problem involved here can no more be avoided than it can be solved. How can one personality enter another? The candid reply would be simply that we do not know, but a near approach to an understanding may be made by a simple analogy borrowed from the old devotional writers of several hundred years ago. We place a piece of iron in a fire and blow up the coals. At first we have two distinct substances, iron and fire. When we insert the iron in the fire, we achieve the penetration of the fire by the iron. Soon the fire begins to penetrate the iron and we have not only the iron in the fire but the fire in the iron as well. They are two distinct substances, but they have co-mingled and interpenetrated to a point where the two have become one.\r\n<p>In some such manner does the Holy Spirit penetrate our spirits. In the whole experience we remain our very selves. There is no destruction of substance. Each remains a separate being as before; the difference is that now the Spirit penetrates and fills our personalities and we are experientially one with God.','2 Timothy 1:14','Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you&#151;guard it with the Holy Spirit who lives in us.','In some such manner does the Holy Spirit penetrate our spirits.','Penetrate our personalities, Spirit, change us from the inside out to make us one with the Father.'),(1498,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'One with and Equal to God','How shall we think of the Holy Spirit? The Bible declares that He is God. Every quality belonging to Almighty God is freely attributed to Him. All that God is, the Spirit is declared to be. The Spirit of God is one with and equal to God just as the spirit of a man is equal to and one with the man. This is so fully taught in the Scriptures that we may without loss to the argument omit the formality of proof texts. The most casual reader will have discovered it for himself.\r\n<p>The historic Church when she formulated her \"rule of faith\" boldly wrote into her confession her belief in the Godhood of the Holy Spirit. The Apostles\' Creed witnesses to faith in the Father and in the Son and in the Holy Spirit, and makes no difference between the Three. The Fathers who composed the Nicene Creed testified in a passage of great beauty to their faith in the deity of the Spirit:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I believe in the Holy Ghost,<br>\r\nThe Lord and Giver of Life,<br>\r\nWho proceedeth from the Father and the Son;<br>\r\nWho with the Father and Son together<br>\r\nIs worshiped and glorified.','1 Corinthians 2:9&#150;10','No eye has seen, / no ear has heard, / no mind has conceived / what God has prepared for those who love him&#151;but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit.','The Spirit of God is one with and equal to God just as the spirit of a man is equal to and one with the man.','Let us worship and glorify the Spirit as is due Him!'),(1499,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'The Deity of the Holy Spirit','The Arian controversy of the fourth century compelled the Fathers to state their beliefs with greater clarity than before. Among the important writings that appeared at that time is the Athanasian Creed. Who composed it matters little to us now. It was written as an attempt to state in as few words as possible what the Bible teaches about the nature of God; and this it has done with a comprehensiveness and precision hardly matched anywhere in the literature of the world. Here are a few quotations bearing on the deity of the Holy Spirit:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n“There is one Person of the Father, another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghost.”<br>\r\n“But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one: the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.”<br>\r\n“And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other: none is greater, or less than another; But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together: and co-equal.”<br>\r\n“So that in all things, as is aforesaid: the Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Uhity is to be worshiped.”<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her sacred hymnody the Church has freely acknowledged the Godhead of the Spirit and in its inspired song it has worshiped Him with joyous abandon. Some of our hymns to the Spirit have become so familiar that we tend to miss their true meaning by the very circumstance of their familiarity. Such a hymn is the wondrous \"Holy Ghost, with Light Divine\"; another is the more recent \"Breathe on Me, Breath of God\"; and there are many others. They have been sung so often by persons who have had no experiential knowledge of their content, that for the most of us they have become almost meaningless.','1 Corinthians 3:16','Don\'t you know that you yourselves are God\'s temple and that God\'s Spirit lives in you?','Some of our hymns to the Spirit have become so familiar that we tend to miss their true meaning by the very circumstance of their familiarity.','Breathe on us, Breathe of God, invade our beings, make us new!'),(1500,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'Unbegotten Love!','In the poetical works of Frederick Faber I have found a hymn to the Holy Spirit that I would rank among the finest ever written, but so far as I know it has not been set to music, or if it has, it is not sung today in any church with which I am acquainted. Could the reason be that it embodies personal experience of the Holy Spirit so deep, so intimate, so fiery hot that it corresponds to nothing in the hearts of the worshipers in present-day evangelicalism? I quote three stanzas:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFountain of Love! Thyself true God!<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who through eternal days<br>\r\nFrom Father and from Son hast flowed<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In uncreated ways!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dread Thee, Unbegotten Love!<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True God! sole Fount of Grace!<br>\r\nAnd now before Thy blessed throne<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sinful self abase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO Light!

Yet they are in complete neglect. I believe that a mighty resurgence of the Spirit\'s power among us will open again wells of hymnody long forgotten. For song can never bring the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit does invariably bring song.','2 Corinthians 3:17','Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.','Song can never bring the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit does invariably bring song.','O Light, O Love, O very God, Holy Spirit, bring a new song to our hearts!'),(1501,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'Deity Present among Us','What we have in the Christian doctrine of the Holy Spirit is Deity present among us.

We dare not think of them in such a way as to \"divide the substance.\" Every act of God is done by all three Persons. God is never anywhere present in one Person without the other two. He cannot divide Himself. Where the Spirit is, there also is the Father and the Son. \"We will come unto him and make our abode with him.\" For the accomplishment of some specific work one Person may for the time be more prominent than the others are, but never is He alone. God is altogether present wherever He is present at all.','John 1:32','I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.','Every act of God is done by all three Persons.

To the question, \"What is the Spirit like?\" the answer must always be, \"He is like Christ.\" For the Spirit is the essence of the Father and the Son. As they are, so is He. As we feel toward Christ and toward our Father who art in heaven, so should we feel toward the Spirit of the Father and the Son.\r\n<p>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and light and love. In His uncreated nature He is a boundless sea of fire, flowing, moving ever, performing as He moves the eternal purposes of God. Toward nature He performs one sort of work, toward the world another and toward the Church still another. And every act of His accords with the will of the Triune God, Never does He act on impulse nor move after a quick or arbitrary decision. Since He is the Spirit of the Father He feels toward His people exactly as the Father feels, so there need be on our part no sense of strangeness in His presence. He will always act like Jesus, toward sinners in compassion, toward saints in warm affection, toward human suffering in tenderest pity and love.','Galatians 5:22','But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.','The Spirit will always act like Jesus, toward sinners in compassion, toward saints in warm affection, toward human suffering in tenderest pity and love.','Thank You, Holy Spirit, for Your compassion, Your affection, Your pity, and Your love.'),(1503,'The Divine Conquest','5','The Forgotten One',NULL,'Neglect Him No More!','It is time for us to repent, for our transgressions against the blessed Third Person have been many and much aggravated. We have bitterly mistreated Him in the house of His friends. We have crucified Him in His own temple as they crucified the Eternal Son on the hill above Jerusalem. And the nails we used were not of iron, but of the finer and more precious stuff of which human life is made. Out of our hearts we took the refined metals of will and feeling and thought, and from them we fashioned the nails of suspicion and rebellion and neglect. By unworthy thoughts about Him and unfriendly attitudes toward Him we grieved and quenched Him days without end.\r\n<p>The truest and most acceptable repentance is to reverse the acts and attitudes of which we repent. A thousand years of remorse over a wrong act would not please God as much as a change of conduct and a reformed life. \"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and. he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\"\r\n<p>We can best repent our neglect by neglecting Him no more.

Let us surrender to Him every room in the temple of our hearts and insist that He enter and occupy as Lord and Master within His own dwelling. And let us remember that He is drawn to the sweet Name of Jesus as bees are drawn to the fragrance of clover.

He is telling us that there is a kind of truth that can never be grasped by the intellect, for the intellect exists for the apprehension of ideas, and this truth consists not in ideas but in life. Divine truth is of the nature of spirit and for that reason can be received only by spiritual revelation. \"Except it be given him from heaven.\"\r\n<p>This was no new doctrine that John here set forth, but an advance rather upon truth already taught in the Old Testament. The prophet Isaiah, for instance, has this passage, \"My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.\" Perhaps this had meant to its readers no more than that God\'s thoughts, while similar to ours, were loftier, and His ways as high above ours as would befit the ways of One whose wisdom is infinite and whose power is without bounds. Now John says plainly enough that God\'s thoughts are not only greater than ours quantitatively but qualitatively wholly different from ours. God\'s thoughts belong to the world of spirit, man\'s to the world of intellect, and while spirit can embrace intellect, the human intellect can never comprehend spirit. Man\'s thoughts cannot cross over into God\'s. \"How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out\"','John 3:27','To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.\"','God\'s thoughts belong to the world of spirit, man\'s to the world of intellect, and while spirit can embrace intellect, the human intellect can never comprehend spirit.','Father God, how unsearchable are Your ways.

When man sinned, that organ died. \"Dead in sin\" is a description not of the body nor yet of the intellect, but of the organ of God-knowledge within the human soul. Now men are forced to depend upon another and inferior organ and one furthermore that is wholly inadequate to the purpose. I mean, of course, the mind as the seat of his powers of reason and understanding.\r\n<p>Man by reason cannot know God; he can only know about God. Through the light of reason certain important facts about God may be discovered. \"Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.\" Through the light of nature man\'s moral reason may be enlightened, but the deeper mysteries of God remain hidden to him until he has received illumination from above. \"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\" When the Spirit illuminates the heart, then a part of the man sees that never saw before; a part of him knows that never knew before, and that with a kind of knowing that the most acute thinker cannot imitate. He knows now in a deep and authoritative way, and what he knows needs no reasoned proof. His experience of knowing is above reason, immediate, perfectly convincing and inwardly satisfying.','1 Corinthians 2:14','The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.','When the Spirit illuminates the heart, then a part of the man sees that never saw before; a part of him knows that never knew before, and that with a kind of knowing that the most acute thinker cannot imitate.','Illuminate our hearts, Holy Spirit, so that we can see what we\'ve never seen before and know what we\'ve never known before.'),(1506,'The Divine Conquest','6','The Illumination of the Spirit',NULL,'Spirit-Taught','\"A man can receive nothing.\" That is the burden of the Bible. Whatever men may think of human reason God takes a low view of it. \"Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?\" Man\'s reason is a fine instrument and useful within its field. It is a gift of God and God does not hesitate to appeal to it, as when He cries to Israel, \"Come now, and let us reason together.\" The inability of human reason as an organ of divine knowledge arises not from its own weakness but from its unfittedness for the task by its own nature. It was not given as an organ by which to know God.\r\n<p>The doctrine of the inability of the human mind and the need for divine illumination is so fully developed in the New Testament that it is nothing short of astonishing that we should have gone so far astray about the whole thing. Fundamentalism has stood aloof from the liberal in self-conscious superiority and has on its own part fallen into error, the error of textualism, which is simply orthodoxy without the Holy Spirit. Everywhere among conservatives we find persons who are Bible-taught but not Spirit-taught. They conceive truth to be something that they can grasp with the mind. If a man hold to the fundamentals of the Christian faith, he is thought to possess divine truth. But it does not follow. There is no truth apart from the Spirit. The most brilliant intellect may be imbecilic when confronted with the mysteries of God. For a man to understand revealed truth requires an act of God equal to the original act that inspired the text.','1 Corinthians 1:20','Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar?

Christ taught His disciples to expect the coming of the Spirit of Truth who would teach them all things. He explained Peter\'s knowledge of His Saviorhood as being a direct revelation from the Father in heaven. And in one of His prayers He said, \"I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\" By \"the wise and prudent\" our Lord meant not Greek philosophers but Jewish Bible students and teachers of the Law.\r\n<p>This basic idea, the inability of human reason as an instrument of God-knowledge, was fully developed in the epistles of Paul. The apostle frankly rules out every natural faculty as instruments for discovering divine truth and throws us back helpless upon the inworking Spirit. \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. For God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.

That type of theological rationalism that is so popular today would have been wholly foreign to the mind of the great apostle. He had not faith in man\'s ability to comprehend truth apart from the direct illumination of the Holy Spirit.\r\n<p>I have just now used the word rationalism, and I must either retract it or justify its use in association with orthodoxy. The latter I think I shall have no trouble doing. For the textualism of our times is based upon the same premise as the old-line rationalism, that is, the belief that the human mind is the supreme authority in the judgment of truth. Or otherwise stated, it is confidence in the ability of the human mind to do that which the Bible declares it was never created to do and consequently is wholly incapable of doing. Philosophical rationalism is honest enough to reject the Bible flatly. Theological rationalism rejects it while pretending to accept it and in so doing puts out its own eyes.','1 Corinthians 2:10&#150;11','The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.

From this mortal error fundamentalism is slowly dying. We have forgotten that the essence of spiritual truth cannot come to the one who knows the external shell of truth unless there is first a miraculous operation of the Spirit within the heart. Those overtones of religious delight that accompany truth when the Spirit illuminates it are all but missing from the Church today. Those transporting glimpses of the Celestial Country are few and dim; the fragrance of \"Sharon\'s dewy Rose\" is hardly discernible. Consequently, we have been forced to look elsewhere for our delights, and we have found them in the dubious artistry of converted opera singers or the tinkling melodies of odd and curious musical arrangements. We have tried to secure spiritual pleasures by working upon fleshly emotions and whipping up synthetic feeling by means wholly carnal. And the total effect has been evil.','1 Corinthians 2:12','We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.','We have forgotten that the essence of spiritual truth cannot come to the one who knows the external shell of truth unless there is first a miraculous operation of the Spirit within the heart.','Our worldly emotions and feelings are not enough, Father.

Divinity is indeed a true efflux from the eternal Light, which like the sunbeams, does not only enlighten, but heat and enliven. . . . We must not think that we have attained to the right knowledge of truth, when we have broken through the outward shell of words and phrases that house it up; . . . There is a knowing of Truth as it is in Jesus, as it is in a Christ-like nature, as it is in that sweet, mild, humble, and loving Spirit of Jesus, which spreads itself like a morning sun upon the souls of good men, full of life and light. It profits little to know Christ Himself after the flesh; but he gives his Spirit to good men that search the deep things of God. There is an inward beauty, life and loveliness in divine Truth, which can be known only when it is digested into life and practice.\"\r\n<p>This old Divine held that a pure life was absolutely necessary to any real understanding of spiritual truth. \"There is,\" he says, \"an inward sweetness and deliciousness in divine truth, which no sensual mind can taste or relish: this is that \'natural\' man that savors not the things of God. . . . Divinity is not so much perceived by a subile wit as by a purified sense.\"','1 Corinthians 2:13','This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.','A pure life is absolutely necessary to any real understanding of spiritual truth.','Purify our hearts, Holy Father, so that we may perceive Your truth.'),(1511,'The Divine Conquest','6','The Illumination of the Spirit',NULL,'A Pure Mind','Twelve hundred years before these words were uttered, Athanasius had written a profound treatise called, \"The Incarnation of the Word of God.\" In this treatise he boldly attacked the difficult problems inherent in the doctrine of the Incarnation. The whole thing is a remarkable demonstration of pure reason engaged with divine revelation. He makes a great case for the deity of Christ, and for all who believe the Bible, settles the matter for all time. Yet so little does he trust the human mind to comprehend divine mysteries that he closes his great work with a strong warning against a mere intellectual understanding of spiritual truth. His words should be printed in large type and tacked on the desk of every pastor and theological student in the world:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for the searching of the Scriptures and true knowledge of them, an honorable life is needed, and a pure soul, and that virtue which is according to Christ; so that the intellect guiding its path by it, may be able to attain what it desires, and to comprehend it, in so far as it is accessible to human nature to learn concerning the word of God. For without a pure mind and a modeling of the life after the saints, a man could not possibly comprehend the words of the saints. . . . He that would comprehend the mind of those who speak of God needs begin by washing and cleansing his soul.\"','2 Corinthians 7:1','Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.','For the searching of the Scriptures and true knowledge of them, an honorable life is needed, and a pure soul, and that virtue which is according to Christ.','Again, Gracious Father, we ask that You purify our souls, so that we can rightly understand Your Word.'),(1512,'The Divine Conquest','6','The Illumination of the Spirit',NULL,'A Visitation of Heavenly Wisdom','The old Jewish believers of pre-Christian times who gave us the (to modern Protestants little-known) books, the Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiastes, believed that it is impossible for an impure heart to know divine truth. \"For into a malicious soul wisdom will not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin. For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in.\"\r\n<p>These books, along with our familiar Book of Proverbs, teach that true spiritual knowledge is the result of a visitation of heavenly wisdom, a kind of baptism of the Spirit of Truth that comes to God-fearing men. This wisdom is always associated with righteousness and humility and is never found apart from godliness and true holiness of life.\r\n<p>Conservative Christians in this day are stumbling over this truth. We need to reexamine the whole thing. We need to learn that truth consists not in correct doctrine, but in correct doctrine plus the inward enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. We must declare again the mystery of wisdom from above. A re-preachment of this vital truth could result in a fresh breath from God upon a stale and suffocating orthodoxy.','Proverbs 9:10','The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, / and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.','We need to learn that truth consists not in correct doctrine, but in correct doctrine plus the inward enlightenment of the Holy Spirit.','We want more than correct doctrine, Lord, we long for an enlightenment of the Holy Spirit.'),(1513,'The Divine Conquest','7','The Spirit as Power',NULL,'The Same','Some good Christians have misread Acts 1:8 and have assumed that Christ told his disciples that they were to receive the Holy Spirit and power, the power to come after the coming of the Spirit. A superficial reading of the King James text might conceivably lead to that conclusion, but the truth is that Christ taught not the coming of the Holy Spirit and power, but the coming of the Holy Spirit as power; the power and the Spirit are the same.\r\n<p>Our mother tongue is a beautiful and facile instrument, but it can also be a tricky and misleading one, and for this reason it must be used with care if we would avoid giving and receiving wrong impressions by its means. Especially is this true when we are speaking of God, for God being wholly unlike anything or anybody in His universe our very thoughts of Him as well as our words are in constant danger of going astray. One example is found in the words, \"The power of God.\" The danger is that we think of \"power\" as something belonging to God as muscular energy belongs to a man, as something that He has and that might be separated from Him and still have existence in itself. We must remember that the \"attributes\" of God are not component parts of the blessed Godhead nor elements out of which He is composed. A god who could be composed would not be God at all but the work of something or someone greater than he, great enough to compose him. We would then have a synthetic God made out of the pieces we call attributes, and the true God would be another Being altogether, One indeed who is above all thought and all conceiving.','Acts 1:8','\"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\"','We must remember that the \"attributes\" of God are not component parts of the blessed Godhead nor elements out of which He is composed.

Mercy, for instance, immutability, eternity, these are but names that we have given to something that God has declared to be true of Himself. All the \"of God\" expressions in the Bible must be understood to mean not what God has but what God is in His undivided and indivisible Unity. Even the word \"nature\" when applied to God should be understood as an accommodation to our human way of looking at things and not as an accurate description of anything true of the mysterious Godhead. God has said, \"I am that I am,\" and we can only repeat in reverence, \"O God, Thou art.\"','Exodus 3:14','God said to Moses, \"I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you.\"','All the \"of God\" expressions in the Bible must be understood to mean not what God has but what God is in His undivided and indivisible Unity.','Help us, as Moses did, to recognize You, Lord God, as who You are.'),(1515,'The Divine Conquest','7','The Spirit as Power',NULL,'Promised Power','Our Lord before His ascension said to His disciples, \"Tarry in the city of Jerusalem until we be endued with power from on high.\" That word \"until\" is a time-word; it indicates a point in relation to which everything is either before or after. So the experience of those disciples could be stated like this: Up to that point they had not received the power; at that point they did receive the power; after that point they had received the power. Such is the plain historic fact. Power came upon the Church, such power as had never been released into human nature before (with the lone exception of that mighty anointing that came upon Christ at the waters of Jordan). That power, still active in the Church, has enabled it to exist for nearly 20 centuries, even though for all of that time it has remained a highly unpopular minority group among the nations of mankind and has always been surrounded by enemies who would gladly have ended its existence if they could have done so.\r\n<p>\"Ye shall receive power.\" By those words our Lord raised the expectation of His disciples and taught them to look forward to the coming of a supernatural potency into their natures from a source outside of themselves. It was to be something previously unknown to them, but suddenly to come upon them from another world. It was to be nothing less than God himself entering into them with the purpose of ultimately reproducing His own likeness within them.','Acts 1:4','Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.','This power God promises us is nothing less than God himself entering into us with the purpose of ultimately reproducing His own likeness within us.','Lord, we long for Your promised power that comes through Your Spirit.'),(1516,'The Divine Conquest','7','The Spirit as Power',NULL,'Resistless Invasion','Here is the dividing line that separates Christianity from all occultism and from every kind of oriental cult ancient or modern. These all are built around the same ideas, varying only in minor details, each with its own peculiar set of phrases and apparently vying with each other in vagueness and obscurity. They each advise, \"Get in tune with the Infinite,\" or \"Wake the giant within you,\" or \"Tune in to your hidden potentialities,\" or \"Learn to think creatively.\" All this may have some fleeting value as a psychological shot in the arm, but its results are not permanent because at its best it builds its hopes upon the fallen nature of man and knows no invasion from above. And whatever may be said in its favor, it most certainly is not Christianity.\r\n<p>Christianity takes for granted the absence of any self-help and offers a power that is nothing less than the power of God. This power is to come upon powerless men as a gentle but resistless invasion from another world bringing a moral potency infinitely beyond anything that might be stirred up from within. This power is sufficient; no additional help is needed, no auxiliary source of spiritual energy, for it is the Holy Spirit of God come where the weakness lay to supply power and grace to meet the moral need','Ephesians 6:10','Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.','Christianity takes for granted the absence of any self-help and offers a power that is nothing less than the power of God.','Thank You, Father, that Your power is sufficient to work our Your will in our lives.'),(1517,'The Divine Conquest','7','The Spirit as Power',NULL,'Supernatural Energy','Set over against such a mighty provision as this ethical Christianity (if I may be allowed the term) is seen to be no Christianity at all. An infantile copying of Christ\'s \"ideals,\" a pitiable effort to carry out the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount. All this is but religious child\'s play and is not the faith of Christ and the New Testament.\r\n<p>\"Ye shall receive power.\" This was and is a unique afflatus, an enduement of supernatural energy affecting every department of the believer\'s life and remaining with him forever. It is not physical power nor even mental power though it may touch everything both mental and physical in its benign outworkings. It is too another kind of power than that seen in nature, in the lunar attraction that creates the tides or the angry flash that splits the great oak during a storm. This power from God operates on another level and affects another department of His wide creation. It is spiritual power. It is the kind of power that God is. It is the ability to achieve spiritual and moral ends. Its long-range result is to produce God-like character in men and women who were once wholly evil by nature and by choice.','Ephesians 3:16','I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being.','All other religions are but child\'s play and not the faith of Christ and the New Testament.','We invite You in our lives, Kind Father, to produce Christ-like character within us.'),(1518,'The Divine Conquest','7','The Spirit as Power',NULL,'Pressure on the Heart','Now how does this power operate? At its purest it is an unmediated force directly applied by the Spirit of God to the spirit of man. The wrestler achieves his ends by the pressure of his physical body upon the body of his opponent, the teacher by the pressure of ideas upon the mind of the student, the moralist by the pressure of duty upon the conscience of the disciple. So the Holy Spirit performs His blessed work by direct contact with the human spirit.\r\n<p>It would be less than accurate to say that the power of God is always experienced in a direct and unmediated form, for when He so wills the Spirit may use other means as Christ used spittle to heal a blind man. But always the power is above and beyond the means. While the Spirit may use appropriate means to bless a believing man, He never need do so for they are at best but temporary concessions made to our ignorance and unbelief. Where adequate power is present almost any means will suffice, but where the power is absent not all the means in the world can secure the desired end. The Spirit of God may use a song, a sermon, a good deed, a text or the mystery and majesty of nature, but always the final work will be done by the pressure of the inliving Spirit upon the human heart.','1 Corinthians 2:5','So that your faith might not rest on men’s wisdom, but on God’s power.','It would be less than accurate to say that the power of God is always experienced in a direct and unmediated form, for when He so wills the Spirit may use other means as Christ used spittle to heal a blind man.','Come and live within us, Spirit, and apply Your pressure on our lives.'),(1519,'The Divine Conquest','7','The Spirit as Power',NULL,'Shadowy Unreality','In the light of this it will be seen how empty and meaningless is the average church service today. All the means are in evidence; the one ominous weakness is the absence of the Spirit\'s power. The form of godliness is there, and often the form is perfected till it is an aesthetic triumph. Music and poetry, art and oratory, symbolic vesture and solemn tones combine to charm the mind of the worshiper, but too often the supernatural afflatus is not there. The power from on high is neither known nor desired by pastor or people. This is nothing less than tragic, and all the more so because it falls within the field of religion where the eternal destinies of men are involved.\r\n<p>To the absence of the Spirit may be traced that vague sense of unreality that almost everywhere invests religion in our times. In the average church service the most real thing is the shadowy unreality of everything. The worshiper sits in a state of suspended mentation; a kind of dreamy numbness creeps upon him; he hears words but they do not register, he cannot relate them to anything on his own life-level. He is conscious of having entered a kind of half-world; his mind surrenders itself to a more or less pleasant mood that passes with the benediction leaving no trace behind. It does not affect anything in his everyday life. He is aware of no power, no Presence, no spiritual reality. There is simply nothing in his experience corresponding to the things that he heard from the pulpit or sang in the hymns.','1 Corinthians 2:4','My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power.','In the average church service today, the most real thing is the shadowy unreality of everything.','We do not want to live powerless lives, Lord. Instead, infuse us with Your power, give us Your presence.'),(1520,'The Divine Conquest','7','The Spirit as Power',NULL,'The Ability to Do','One meaning of the word \"power\" is \"ability to do.\" There precisely is the wonder of the Spirit\'s work in the Church and in the hearts of Christians, His sure ability to make spiritual things real to the soul. This power can go straight to its object with piercing directness; it can diffuse itself through the mind like an infinitely fine volatile essence securing ends above and beyond the limits of the intellect. Reality is its subject matter, reality in heaven and upon earth. It does not create objects that are not there but reveals objects already present and hidden from the soul. In actual human experience this is likely to be the first felt in a heightened sense of the Presence of Christ. He is felt to be a real Person and to be intimately, ravishingly near. Then all other spiritual objects begin to stand out clearly before the mind. Grace, forgiveness, cleansing take on a form of almost bodily clearness. Prayer loses its unmeaning quality and becomes a sweet conversation with Someone actually there. Love for God and for the children of God takes possession of the soul. We feel ourselves near to heaven and it is now the earth and the world that begin to seem unreal. We know them now for what they are, realities indeed, but like stage scenery here for one brief hour and soon to pass away. The world to come takes on a hard outline before our minds and begins to invite our interest and our devotion. Then the whole life changes to suit the new reality and the change is permanent. Slight fluctuations there may be like the rise and dip of the line on a graph, but the established direction is upward and the ground taken is held.','1 Corinthians 4:20','For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.','One meaning of the word \"power\" is \"ability to do.\" There precisely is the wonder of the Spirit\'s work in the Church and in the hearts of Christians, His sure ability to make spiritual things real to the soul.','Father, show the reality of Your world and let our world begin to fade away.'),(1521,'The Divine Conquest','7','The Spirit as Power',NULL,'The Great Need','This is not all, but it will give a fair idea of what is meant when the New Testament speaks of power, and perhaps by contrast we may learn how little of the power we enjoy.\r\n<p>I think there can be no doubt that the need above all other needs in the Church of God at this moment is the power of the Holy Spirit.

They are altogether too busy playing with shadows and getting \"adjusted\" to one thing and another to spend much time thinking about God.

Where God is known at all it must be otherwise than by our creature-reason.\r\n<p>Novatian, in a famous treatise on the Trinity written sometime about the middle of the third century, says, \"In all our meditations upon the qualities of the attributes and content of God, we pass beyond our powers of fit conception, nor can human eloquence put forth a power commensurate with His greatness. At the contemplation and utterance of His majesty, all eloquence is rightly dumb, all mental effort is feeble. For God is greater than mind itself. His greatness cannot be conceived. Nay, if we could conceive of His greatness, He would be less than the human mind which could form the conception. He is greater than all language, and no statement can express Him. Indeed, if any statement could express Him, He would be less than human speech, which could by such statement comprehend and gather up all that He is. Up to a certain point, of course, we can have experience of Him, without language, but no man can express in words all that He is in Himself. Suppose, for instance, one speaks of Him as light; this is an account of part of His creation, not of Himself. It does not express what He is. Or suppose one speaks of Him as power. This too sets forth in words His attribute of might, rather than His being. Or suppose one speaks of Him as majesty. Once again, we have a declaration of the honor which is His Own, rather than of Him in Himself. . . . To sum up the matter in a single sentence, every possible statement that can be made about God expresses some possession or virtue of God, rather than God Himself. What words or thoughts are worthy of Him, Who is above all language and all thought?

God has used a number of these similitudes to hint at His incomprehensible being, and judging from the Scriptures one would gather that His favorite similitude is fire. In one place the Spirit speaks expressly, \"For our God is a consuming fire.\" This accords with His revelation of Himself as recorded throughout the Bible. As a fire He spoke to Moses from the burning bush; in the fire He dwelt above the camp of Israel through all the wilderness journey; as fire He dwelt between the wings of the cherubim in the Holy of Holies; to Ezekiel He revealed Himself as a strange brightness of \"a fire infolding itself.\" \"I saw as it were the appearance of a fire and it had a brightness round about.

The God who had appeared to them as fire throughout all their long history was now dwelling in them as fire. He had moved from without to the interior of their lives. The Shekinah that had once blazed over the mercy seat now blazed on their foreheads as an external emblem of the fire that had invaded their natures. This was Deity giving Himself to ransomed men.

He has been and is so widely misunderstood that the very mention of His name in some circles is enough to frighten many people into resistance. The source of this unreasoning fear may easily be traced, but it would be a fruitless labor to do it here. Sufficient to say that the fear is groundless. Perhaps we may help to destroy its power over us if we examine that fire that is the symbol of the Spirit\'s Person and Presence.\r\n<p>The Holy Spirit is first of all a <i>moral flame</i>. It is not an accident of language that He is called the Holy Spirit, for whatever else the word holy may mean, it does undoubtedly carry with it the idea of moral purity. And the Spirit, being God, must be absolutely and infinitely pure. With Him there are not (as with men) grades and degrees of holiness. He is holiness itself, the sum and essence of all that is unspeakably pure.','Isaiah 10:17','The Light of Israel will become a fire, / their Holy One a flame; / in a single day it will burn and consume / his thorns and his briers.','It is not an accident of language that the Spirit is called the Holy Spirit, for whatever else the word holy may mean, it does undoubtedly carry with it the idea of moral purity.','Holy Spirit, do Your work in us to make us holy, pure.'),(1529,'The Divine Conquest','8','The Holy Spirit as Fire',NULL,'A Moral Contradiction','No one whose senses have been exercised to know good and evil but must grieve over the sight of zealous souls seeking to be filled with the Holy Spirit while they are yet living in a state of moral carelessness or borderline sin.

No joys are valid, no delights legitimate where sin is allowed to live in life or conduct. No transgression of pure righteousness dare excuse itself on the ground of superior religious experience. To seek high emotional states while living in sin is to throw our whole life open to self-deception and the judgment of God. \"Be ye holy\" is not a mere motto to be framed and hung on the wall.

The coming of the Spirit brought to the Book of Acts this very quality of supra-mundaneness, this mysterious elevation of tone not found in as high intensity even in the Gospels. The key of the Book of Acts is definitely the major. There is in it no trace of creature-sadness, no lingering disappointment, no quaver of uncertainty. The mood is heavenly. A victorious spirit is found there, a spirit that could never be the result of mere religious belief. The joy of the first Christians was not the joy of logic working on facts. They did not reason, \"Christ is risen from the dead; therefore we ought to be glad.\" Their gladness was as great a miracle as the resurrection itself; indeed these were and are organically related. The moral happiness of the Creator had taken residence in the breasts of redeemed creatures and they could not but be glad.','Acts 2:4','All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.','Morality and ethics, however lofty, are not Christianity.','Make us glad, Kind Father, as we realize the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives.'),(1531,'The Divine Conquest','8','The Holy Spirit as Fire',NULL,'Intellectual Flame','The flame of the Spirit is also <i>intellectual</i>. Reason, say the theologians, is one of the divine attributes. There need be no incompatibilty between the deepest experiences of the Spirit and the highest attainments of the human intellect. It is only required that the Christian intellect be fully surrendered to God, and there need be no limit to its activities beyond those imposed upon it by its own strength and size. How cold and deadly is the unblessed intellect. A superior brain without the saving essence of godliness may turn against the human race and drench the world with blood, or worse, it may loose ideas into the earth that will continue to curse mankind for centuries after it has turned to dust again. But a Spirit-filled mind is a joy to God and a delight to all men of good will. What would the world have missed if it had been deprived of the love-filled mind of a David or a John or an Isaac Watts?','Romans 14:17','For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.','A superior brain without the saving essence of godliness may turn against the human race and drench the world with blood, or worse, it may loose ideas into the earth that will continue to curse mankind for centuries after it has turned to dust again.','Spirit, come and fill our minds so that we might be a joy to the Father and a delight to men.'),(1532,'The Divine Conquest','8','The Holy Spirit as Fire',NULL,'A Mild and Healing Ray','We naturally shy away from superlatives and from comparisons that praise one virtue at the expense of another, yet I wonder whether there is on earth anything as exquisitely lovely as a brilliant mind aglow with the love of God. Such a mind sheds a mild and healing ray that can actually be felt by those who come near it. Virtue goes forth from it and blesses those who merely touch the hem of its garment. One has, for instance, but to read The Celestial Country, by Bernard of Cluny, to understand what I mean. There a sensitive and shining intellect warm with the fire of the in-living Spirit writes with a vast and tender sympathy of those longings for immortality that have dwelt deep in the human breast since the first man kneeled down upon the earth out of whose bosom he came and into whose bosom he must soon return again. For loftiness of concept, for sheer triumph of the Christian spirit over mortality, for ability to rest the soul and raise the mind to rapturous worship its equal is hardly found anywhere in uninspired literature. I submit it as my respectful opinion that this single hymn may have ministered more healing virtue to distressed spirits than all the writings of secular poets and philosophers since the art of writing was invented. No unblessed intellect, however sure its genius, would be remotely capable of producing such a work. One closes the book after reading it with the feeling, yes the solemn conviction, that he has heard the voice of the cherubim and the sound of harpers strumming beside the sea of God.','Matthew 9:20','Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.','We naturally shy away from superlatives and from comparisons that praise one virtue at the expense of another, yet I wonder whether there is on earth anything as exquisitely lovely as a brilliant mind aglow with the love of God.','We want out intellects to glow with Your love, Father, so that we might draw others to You.'),(1533,'The Divine Conquest','8','The Holy Spirit as Fire',NULL,'Vital Necessity','This same feeling of near-inspiration is experienced also in the letters of Samuel Rutherford, in the Te Deum, in many of the hymns of Watts and Wesley, and occasionally in a work of some lesser known saint whose limited gifts may have been for one joyous moment made incandescent by the fire of the indwelling Spirit.\r\n<p>The blight of the Pharisee\'s heart in olden times was doctrine without love. With the teachings of the Pharisees Christ had little quarrel, but with the pharisaic spirit He carried on unceasing warfare to the end. It was religion that put Christ on the cross, religion without the indwelling Spirit. It is no use to deny that Christ was crucified by persons who would today be called fundamentalists. This should prove most disquieting if not downright distressing to us who pride ourselves on our orthodoxy. An unblessed soul filled with the letter of truth may actually be worse off than a pagan kneeling before a fetish. We are safe only when the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, only when our intellects are indwelt by the loving Fire that came at Pentecost. For the Holy Spirit is not a luxury, not something added now and again to produce a deluxe type of Christian once in a generation. No, He is for every child of God a vital necessity, and that He fill and indwell His people is more than a languid hope. It is rather an inescapable imperative.','Luke 11:52','\"Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.\"','blight of the Pharisee\'s heart in olden times was doctrine without love','We need Your love, Holy Father, in our hearts; we need Your loving Fire in our minds.'),(1534,'The Divine Conquest','8','The Holy Spirit as Fire',NULL,'Volitional Flame','The Spirit is also a <i>volitional flame</i>. Here as elsewhere the imagery is inadequate to express all the truth, and unless care is taken we may easily gain a wrong impression from its use. For fire as we see and know it every day is a thing, not a person, and for that reason it has no will of its own. But the Holy Spirit is a Person, having those attributes of personality of which volition is one. He does not, upon entering the human soul, void any of His attributes, nor does He surrender them in part or in full to the soul into whom He enters. Remember, the Holy Spirit is Lord. \"Now the Lord is that Spirit,\" said Paul to the Corinthians. The Nicene Creed says, \"And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life,\" and the Athanasian Creed declares, \"So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords: but one Lord.\" Whatever problems this may pose for the understanding, our faith must accept it and make it a part of our total belief about God and the Spirit. Now it hardly need be said that the Sovereign Lord will never abandon the prerogatives of His Godhood. Wherever He is He must continue to act like Himself. When He enters the human heart He will be there what He has always been, Lord in His own right.','2 Corinthians 3:17','Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.','The Holy Spirit does not, upon entering the human soul, void any of His attributes, nor does He surrender them in part or in full to the soul into whom He enters.','Lord, we recognize that Your Spirit is part of the Godhead and that You always will act like Yourself.'),(1535,'The Divine Conquest','8','The Holy Spirit as Fire',NULL,'The Disease of Disobedience and Revolt','The deep disease of the human heart is a will broken loose from its center, like a planet that has left its central sun and started to revolve around some strange body from outer space that may have moved in close enough to draw it away. When Satan said, \"I will,\" he broke loose from his normal center, and the disease with which he has infected the human race is the disease of disobedience and revolt. Any adequate scheme of redemption must take into account this revolt and must undertake to restore again the human will to its proper place in the will of God. In accord with this underlying need for the healing of the will, the Holy Spirit, when He effects His gracious invasion of the believing heart, must win that heart to glad and voluntary obedience to the whole will of God. The cure must be wrought from within; no outward conformity will do. Until the will is sanctified the man is still a rebel just as an outlaw is still an outlaw at heart even though he may be yielding grudging obedience to the sheriff who is taking him to prison.','Isaiah 63:10','Yet they rebelled / and grieved his Holy Spirit.','The deep disease of the human heart is a will broken loose from its center, like a planet that has left its central sun and started to revolve around some strange body from outer space that may have moved in close enough to draw it away.','Draw us into Your sphere, Lord; bend our wills toward Yours.'),(1536,'The Divine Conquest','8','The Holy Spirit as Fire',NULL,'A Merged Will','The Holy Spirit achieves this inward cure by merging the will of the redeemed man with His own, This is not accomplished at one stroke. There must be, it is true, some kind of over-all surrender of the will to Christ before any work of grace can be done, but the full mergence of every part of the life with the life of God in the Spirit is likely to be a longer process than we in our creature impatience would wish. The most advanced soul may be shocked and chagrined to discover some private area within his life where he had been, unknown to himself, acting as lord and proprietor of that which he thought he had given to God. It is the work of the in-living Spirit to point out these moral discrepancies and correct them. He does not, as is sometimes said, \"break\" the human will, but He does invade it and bring it gently to a joyous union with the will of God.\r\n<p>To will the will of God is to do more than give unprotesting consent to it; it is rather to choose God\'s will with positive determination. As the work of God advances the Christian finds himself free to choose whatever he will, and he gladly chooses the will of God as his highest conceivable good. Such a man has found life\'s highest goal. He has been placed beyond the little disappointments that plague the rest of men. Whatever happens to him is the will of God for him and that is just what he most ardently desires. But it is only fair to state that this condition is one not reached by many of the busy Christians of our busy times. Until it is reached, however, the Christian\'s peace cannot be complete. There must be still a certain inward controversy, a sense of spiritual disquiet that poisons our joy and greatly reduces our power.','Ephesians 3:16','I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being.','To will the will of God is to do more than give unprotesting consent to it; it is rather to choose God\'s will with positive determination.','Lord, help us to merge our wills with Your will and to choose Your will with positive, complete determination.'),(1537,'The Divine Conquest','8','The Holy Spirit as Fire',NULL,'Emotion','Another quality of the in-dwelling Fire is <i>emotion</i>. This must be understood in the light of what has been said before about the divine inscrutability. What God is in His unique essence cannot be discovered by the mind nor uttered by the lips, but those qualities in God that may be termed rational, and so received by the intellect, have been freely set forth in the sacred Scriptures. They do not tell us what God is, but they do tell us what God is like, and the sum of them constitute a mental picture of the Divine Being seen as it were afar off and through a glass darkly.\r\n<p>Now the Bible teaches that there is something in God that is like emotion. He experiences something that is like our love, something that is like our grief, that is like our joy. And we need not fear to go along with this conception of what God is like. Faith would easily draw the inference that since we were made in His image He would have qualities like our own. But such an inference, while satisfying to the mind, is not the ground of our belief. God has said certain things about Himself, and these furnish all the grounds we require. \"The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing\" (Zephaniah 3:17). This is but one verse among thousands that serve to form our rational picture of what God is like, and they tell us plainly that God feels something like our love, like our joy, and what He feels makes Him act very much as we would in a similar situation; He rejoices over His loved ones with joy and singing.','Zephaniah 3:17','\"The Lord your God is with you, / he is mighty to save. / He will take great delight in you, / he will quiet you with his love, / he will rejoice over you with singing.\"','The Bible teaches that there is something in God that is like emotion.

Feeling, then, is not the degenerate son of unbelief that it is often painted by some of our Bible teachers. Our ability to feel is one of the marks of our divine origin. We need not be ashamed of either tears or laughter. The Christian stoic who has crushed his feelings is only two-thirds of a man; an important third part has been repudiated.\r\n<p>Holy feeling had an important place in the life of our Lord. \"For the joy that was set before Him\" He \'endured the cross and despised its shame. He pictured Himself crying, \"Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.\" On the night of His agony He \"sang an hymn\" before going out to the Mount of Olives. After His resurrection He sang among His brethren in the great congregation (Psalm 22:22). And if the Song of Solomon refers to Christ (as most Christians believe it does), then how are we to miss the sound of His rejoicing as He brings His bride home after the night has ended and the shadows have fled away?','Hebrews 12:2','Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross.','Our ability to feel is one of the marks of our divine origin.

The objection to \"sinful pleasures\" that has always been characteristic of the true saint, is at bottom simply a protest against the degradation of our human emotions. That gambling, for instance, should be allowed to engross the interests of men made in the image of God has seemed \'like a horrible perversion of noble powers; that alcohol should be necessary to stimulate the feeling of pleasure has seemed like a kind of prostitution; that men should turn to the man-made theatre for enjoyment has seemed an affront to the God who placed us in the midst of a universe charged with high dramatic action. The world\'s artificial pleasures are all but evidence that the human race has to a large extent lost its power to enjoy the true pleasures of life and is forced to substitute for them false and degrading thrills.','Galatians 5:17','For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature.','The objection to \"sinful pleasures\" that has always been characteristic of the true saint, is at bottom simply a protest against the degradation of our human emotions.','Take away our love of man-made enjoyment, Father, and replace it with a love for the true pleasures of life.'),(1540,'The Divine Conquest','8','The Holy Spirit as Fire',NULL,'Constant Music','The work of the Holy Spirit is, among other things, to rescue the redeemed man\'s emotions, to restring his harp and open again the wells of sacred joy that have been stopped up by sin.

The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, because I testify of it that the works thereof are evil.\" He identified His fleshly brethren with the world and said that they and He were of two different spirits. The world hated Him but could not hate them because it could not hate itself. A house divided against itself cannot stand. Adam\'s house must remain loyal to itself or it will tear itself apart. Though the sons of the flesh may quarrel among themselves they are at bottom one with each other.

The spirit of the Pharisees was actively and maliciously hostile to the Spirit of Jesus as each was a kind of distillation of the two worlds from whence they came.','Matthew 12:38&#150;39','Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, \"Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.\" He answered, \"A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign!\"','Our warfare is not against mere worldly ways, but against the spirit of the world.','Help us, Holy Father, to never be like the Pharisees, who were hostile to You and Your Son.'),(1551,'The Divine Conquest','9','Why the World Cannot Receive',NULL,'Kingdom of Renewed Men','Those present-day teachers who place the Sermon on the Mount in some other dispensation than this and so release the Church from its teachings, little realize the evil they do. For the Sermon on the Mount gives in brief the characteristics of the Kingdom of renewed men. The blessed poor who mourn for their sins and thirst after righteousness are true sons of the Kingdom. In meekness they show mercy to their enemies; with guileless candor they gaze upon God; surrounded by persecutors they bless and curse not. In modesty they hide their good deeds. They go out of their way to agree with their adversaries and forgive those who sin against them. They serve God in secret in the depth of their hearts and wait with patience for His open reward. They freely surrender their earthly goods rather than use violence to protect them. They lay up their treasures in heaven. They avoid praise and wait for the day of final reckoning to learn who is greatest in the Kingdom of heaven.\r\n<p>If this is a fairly accurate view of things, what can we say then when Christian men vie with one another for place and position? What can we answer when we see them hungrily seeking for praise and honor? How can we excuse that passion for publicity that is so glaringly evident among Christian leaders? What about political ambition in Church circles? What about the fevered palm that is stretched out for more and bigger \"love offerings\"? What about the shameless egotism among Christians? How can we explain the gross man-worship that habitually blows up one and another popular leader to the size of a colossus? What about the obsequious hand kissing of moneyed men by those purporting to be sound preachers of the gospel?\r\n<p>There is only one answer to these questions; it is simply that in these manifestations we see the world and nothing but the world. No passionate profession of love for \"souls\" can change evil into good. These are the very sins that crucified Jesus.','Matthew 5:3','Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.','If the Sermon on the Mount is a fairly accurate view of things, what can we say then when Christian men vie with one another for place and position?','Take away our love of the world, Kind Father, and replace it with a love for You and Your Kingdom.'),(1552,'The Divine Conquest','9','Why the World Cannot Receive',NULL,'A Clean Break','It is true also that the grosser manifestations of fallen human nature are part of the kingdom of this world. Organized amusements with their emphasis upon shallow pleasure, the great empires built upon vicious and unnatural habits, unrestrained abuse of the normal appetites, the artificial world called \"high society.\" These all are of the world. They are all part of that which is flesh, which builds upon flesh and must perish with the flesh. And from these things the Christian must flee. All these he must put behind him and in them he must have no part. Against them he must stand quietly but firmly without compromise and without fear.\r\n<p>So whether the world present itself in its uglier aspects or in its subtler and more refined forms, we must recognize it for what it is and repudiate it bluntly. We must do this if we would walk with God in our generation as Enoch did in his. A clean break with the world is imperative. \"Ye adulterers and adultresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is an enemy of God\" (James 4:4). \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world\" (1 John 2:15&#150;16). These words of God are not before us for our consideration; they are there for our obedience and we have no right to claim the title of Christian unless we follow them.','James 4:4','You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God?','Whether the world present itself in its uglier aspects or in its subtler and more refined forms, we must recognize it for what it is and repudiate it bluntly.','Father, we need to make a clean break with the world and learn to love You with all our beings.'),(1553,'The Divine Conquest','9','Why the World Cannot Receive',NULL,'Sharp Separation','For myself, I fear any kind of religious stir among Christians that does not lead to repentance and result in a sharp separation of the believer from the world. I am suspicious of any organized revival effort that is forced to play down the hard terms of the Kingdom. No matter how attractive the movement may appear, if it is not founded in righteousness and nurtured in humility it is not of God. If it exploits the flesh it is a religious fraud and should not have the support of any God-fearing Christian. Only that is of God which honors the Spirit and prospers at the expense of the human ego. \"That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"','1 John 2:16','For everything in the world&#151;the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does&#151;comes not from the Father but from the world.','No matter how attractive the movement may appear, if it is not founded in righteousness and nurtured in humility it is not of God.','As we turn away from this world, Lord, let us glorify You with our lives.'),(1554,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'A Copious Outpouring','That every Christian can be and should be filled with the Holy Spirit would hardly seem to be a matter for debate among Christians. Yet some will argue that the Holy Spirit is not for plain Christians but for ministers and missionaries only. Others hold that the measure of the Spirit received at regeneration is identical with that received by the disciples at Pentecost and any hope of additional fullness after conversion simply rests upon error. A few will express a languid hope that some day they may be filled, and still others will avoid the subject as one about which they know little and which can only cause embarrassment.\r\n<p>I want here boldly to assert that it is my happy belief that every Christian can have a copious outpouring of the Holy Spirit in a measure far beyond that received at conversion, and I might also say, far beyond that enjoyed by the rank and file of orthodox believers today. It is important that we get this straight, for until doubts are removed faith is impossible. God will not surprise a doubting heart with an effusion of the Holy Spirit, nor will He fill anyone who has doctrinal questions about the possibility of being filled.','Ephesians 5:18','Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.','I want here boldly to assert that it is my happy belief that every Christian can have a copious outpouring of the Holy Spirit in a measure far beyond that received at conversion, and I might also say, far beyond that enjoyed by the rank and file of orthodox believers today.','Lord, answer our doubting hearts and fill us with Your Spirit.'),(1555,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'Can We Be Filled?','To remove doubts and create a confident expectation I recommend a reverent study of the Word of God itself. I am willing to rest my case upon the teachings of the New Testament. If a careful and humble examination of the words of Christ and His apostles does not lead to a belief that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit now, then I see no reason to look elsewhere. For it matters little what this or that religious teacher has said for or against the proposition. If the doctrine is not taught in the Scriptures then it cannot be supported by any argument, and all exhortations to be filled are valueless.\r\n<p>I shall not here present a case for the affirmative. Let the inquirer examine the evidence for himself, and if he decides that there is no warrant in the New Testament for believing that he can be filled with the Spirit, let him shut this book and save himself the trouble of reading further. What I say from here on is addressed to men and women who have gotten over their questions and are confident that when they meet the conditions they may indeed be filled with the Holy Spirit.','Acts 2:4','All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit.','Let the inquirer examine the evidence for himself, and if he decides that there is no warrant in the New Testament for believing that he can be filled with the Spirit, let him shut this book and save himself the trouble of reading further.','We don’t want answers to our questions, Holy Father, we want to filled with Your Spirit.'),(1556,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'Lord of Our Lives','Before a man can be filled with the Spirit he must be sure he wants to be. And let this be taken seriously. Many Christians want to be filled, but their desire is a vague romantic kind of thing hardly worthy to be called desire. They have almost no knowledge of what it will cost them to realize it.\r\n<p>Let us imagine that we are talking to an inquirer, some eager young Christian, let us say, who has sought us out to learn about the Spirit-filled life. As gently as possible, considering the pointed nature of the questions, we would probe his soul somewhat as follows: \"Are you sure you want to be filled with a Spirit who, though He is like Jesus in His gentleness and love, will nevertheless demand to be Lord of your life? Are you willing to let your personality be taken over by another, even if that other be the Spirit of God Himself?','Acts 9:17','Then Ananias . . . placing his hands on Saul, . . . said, “Brother Saul, the Lord&#151;Jesus, how appeared to you on the road as you were coming here&#151;has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.','Many Christians want to be filled, but their desire is a vague romantic kind of thing hardly worthy to be called desire. They have almost no knowledge of what it will cost them to realize it.','Take over our hearts and lives, Holy Spirit. Come in and fill us with divine personality.'),(1557,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'Unquestioned Obedience','If the Spirit takes charge of your life He will expect unquestioning obedience in everything. He will not tolerate in you the self-sins even though they are permitted and excused by most Christians. By the self-sins I mean self-love, self-pity, self-seeking, self-confidence, self-righteousness, self-aggrandizement, self-defense. You will find the Spirit to be in sharp opposition to the easy ways of the world and of the mixed multitude within the precincts of religion. He will be jealous over you for good. He will not allow you to boast or swagger or show off. He will take the direction of your life away from you. He will reserve the right to test you, to discipline you, to chasten you for your soul\'s sake. He may strip you of many of those borderline pleasures that other Christians enjoy but that are to you a source of refined evil. Through it all He will enfold you in a love so vast, so mighty, so all-embracing, so wondrous that your very losses will seem like gains and your small pains like pleasures. Yet the flesh will whimper under His yoke and cry out against it as a burden too great to bear. And you will be permitted to enjoy the solemn privilege of suffering to fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in your flesh for His body\'s sake, which is the Church. Now, with the conditions before you, do you still want to be filled with the Holy Spirit?\"\r\n<p>If this appears severe, let us remember that the way of the cross is never easy. The shine and glamour accompanying popular religious movements is as false as the sheen on the wings of the angel of darkness when he for a moment transforms himself into an angel of light. The spiritual timidity that fears to show the cross in its true character is not on any grounds to be excused. It can result only in disappointment and tragedy at last.','Matthew 16:24','Then Jesus said to his disciples, \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\"','The shine and glamour accompanying popular religious movements is as false as the sheen on the wings of the angel of darkness when he for a moment transforms himself into an angel of light.','Give us the desire, Kind Father, to be filled with Your Holy Spirit.'),(1558,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'All-consuming Desire','Before we can be filled with the Spirit the desire to be filled must be all-consuming. It must be for the time the biggest thing in the life, so acute, so intrusive as to crowd out everything else. The degree of fullness in any life accords perfectly with the intensity of true desire. We have as much of God as we actually want. One great hindrance to the Spirit-filled life is the theology of complacency so widely accepted among gospel Christians today. According to this view acute desire is an evidence of unbelief and proof of lack of knowledge of the Scriptures. A sufficient refutation of this position is afforded by the Word of God itself and by the fact that it always fails to produce real saintliness among those who hold it.','Mark 9:24','Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, \"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\"','Before we can be filled with the Spirit the desire to be filled must be all-consuming. It must be for the time the biggest thing in the life, so acute, so intrusive as to crowd out everything else.','Clear our minds, Father, and let the desire for Your Spirit be all-consuming in our lives.'),(1559,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'Enemy of the Spiritual Life','Then, I doubt whether anyone ever received that divine afflatus with which we are here concerned who did not first experience a period of deep anxiety and inward agitation. Religious contentment is the enemy of the spiritual life always. The biographies of the saints teach that the way to spiritual greatness has always been through much suffering and inward pain. The phrase, \"the way of the cross,\" though it has come in certain circles to denote something very beautiful, even enjoyable, still means to the real Christian what it has always meant, the way of rejection and loss. No one ever enjoyed a cross, just as no one ever enjoyed a gallows.','Matthew 10:38','Anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.','Religious contentment is the enemy of the spiritual life always.','Help us, Lord, to take up our crosses and follow You with our whole hearts.'),(1560,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'One of the Heart’s Most Potent Enemies','The Christian who is seeking better things and who has to his consternation found himself in a state of complete self-despair need not be discouraged. Despair with self, where it is accompanied by faith, is a good friend, for it destroys one of the heart\'s most potent enemies and prepares the soul for the ministration of the Comforter. A sense of utter emptiness, of disappointment and darkness can (if we are alert and wise to what is going on) be the shadow in the valley of shadows that leads on to those fruitful fields that lie further in. If we misunderstand it and resist this visitation of God we may miss entirely every benefit a kind heavenly Father has in mind for us. If we cooperate with God He will take away the natural comforts that have served us as mother and nurse for so long and put us where we can receive no help except from the Comforter Himself. He will tear away that false thing the Chinese call \"face\" and show us how painfully small we really are. When He is finished with us we will know what our Lord meant when He said, \"Blessed are the poor in spirit.\"','Psalm 23:4','Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, / I will fear no evil, / for you are with me.','If we cooperate with God He will take away the natural comforts that have served us as mother and nurse for so long and put us where we can receive no help except from the Comforter Himself.','Tear away every false thing in our lives, Holy Spirit, and show us how painfully small we really are!'),(1561,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'He Will Never Leave Us','Be sure, however, that in these painful chastenings we shall not be deserted by our God. He will never leave us nor forsake us, nor will He be wroth with us nor rebuke us. He will not break His covenant nor alter that which has gone out of His mouth. He will keep us as the apple of His eye and watch over us as a mother watches over her child. His love will not fail even while He is taking us through this experience of self-crucifixion so real, so terrible, that we can express it only by crying, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"','Hebrews 13:5','God has said, \"Never will I leave you; / never will I forsake you.\"','His love will not fail even while He is taking us through this experience of self-crucifixion so real, so terrible, that we can express it only by crying, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"','Thank You, Kind Father, for Your promise that You will never leave us or forsake us.'),(1562,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'Centuries-old Adamic Trash','Now let us keep our theology straight about all this. There is not in this painful stripping one remote thought of human merit. The \"dark night of the soul\" knows not one dim ray of the treacherous light of self-righteousness. We do not by suffering earn the anointing for which we yearn, nor does this devastation of soul make us dear to God nor give us additional favor in His eyes. The value of the stripping experience lies in its power to detach us from life\'s passing interests and to throw us back upon eternity. It serves to empty our earthly vessels and prepare us for the inpouring of the Holy Spirit.\r\n<p>The filling with the Spirit, then, requires that we give up our all, that we undergo an inward death, that we rid our hearts of that centuries-old accumulation of Adamic trash and open all rooms to the heavenly Guest.','Psalm 139:12','Even the darkness will not be dark to you; / the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.','The filling with the Spirit, then, requires that we give up our all, that we undergo an inward death, that we rid our hearts of that centuries-old accumulation of Adamic trash and open all rooms to the heavenly Guest.','Strip away the centuries-old Adamic trash that clogs our minds and hearts, Father, and replace it with the light of Your Spirit.'),(1563,'The Divine Conquest','10','The Spirit-filled Life',NULL,'A Living Person','The Holy Spirit is a living Person and should be treated as a person. We must never think of Him as a blind energy nor as an impersonal force. He hears and sees and feels as any person does. He speaks and hears us speak. We can please Him or grieve Him or silence Him as we can any other person. He will respond to our timid effort to know Him and will ever meet us over half the way.\r\n<p>However wonderful the crisis-experience of being filled with the Spirit, we should remember that it is only a means toward something greater: that greater thing is the life-long walk in the Spirit, indwelt, directed, taught and empowered by His mighty Person. And to continue thus to walk in the Spirit requires that we meet certain conditions. These are laid down for us in the sacred Scriptures and are there for all to see.','1 John 1:7','If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.','However wonderful the crisis-experience of being filled with the Spirit, we should remember that it is only a means toward something greater: that greater thing is the life-long walk in the Spirit, indwelt, directed, taught and empowered by His mighty Person.','Timidly we walk toward You, Holy Father.

By this I do not mean that we study the Bible merely, nor that we take a \"course\" in Bible doctrine. I mean that we should \"meditate day and night\" in the sacred Word, that we should love it and feast upon it and digest it every hour of the day and night. When the business of life compels our attention we may yet, by a kind of blessed mental reflex, keep the Word of Truth ever before our minds.\r\n<p>Then if we would please the in-dwelling Spirit we must be all taken up with Christ. The Spirit\'s present work is to honor Him, and everything He does has this for its ultimate purpose. And we must make our thoughts a clean sanctuary for His holy habitation.
